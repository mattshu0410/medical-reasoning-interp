The family history suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance since the father has similar findings.\\n\\nKey features include:\\n- Skeletal abnormalities: clavicular hypoplasia, scoliosis, pelvic abnormalities, coxa vara, slender long bones.\\n- Craniofacial abnormalities: frontal bossing, hypertelorism, mid-face deficiency, high-arched palate, dental anomalies (impacted and over-retained teeth).\\n- Wormian bones in the skull.\\n- Normal intelligence.\\n\\nThis sounds familiar. Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) comes to mind. Let me verify if it matches.\\n\\nCleidocranial dysplasia is characterized by:\\n- Hypoplasia or aplasia of clavicles (leading to drooping shoulders).\\n- Delayed closure of fontanelles and cranial sutures with wormian bones.\\n- Dental anomalies: supernumerary teeth, delayed eruption, over-retained deciduous teeth.\\n- Short stature.\\n- Other skeletal features: coxa vara, pelvic abnormalities, slender bones.\\n\\nYes, that seems to fit. The facial features like frontal bossing and mid-face deficiency are also common in CCD. Intelligence is usually normal in CCD, which matches here.\\n\\nLet me double-check if there's any other condition that might fit. For example, osteogenesis imperfecta can have wormian bones and bone fragility, but the clavicular hypoplasia and dental anomalies are more specific to CCD. Also, in osteogenesis imperfecta, there might be bone fractures, which aren't mentioned here.\\n\\nAnother condition is pyknodysostosis, but that involves osteosclerosis and short stature, but not typically clavicular hypoplasia or the same dental issues.\\n\\nSo, cleidocranial dysplasia seems the most likely.\\n\\nThe output should be just the name of the disease within the <answer> tags.\\n\\nTherefore, the final diagnosis is Cleidocranial Dysplasia.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"verification_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"y\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Introduction Bartonella henselae ( B. henselae ) is a Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the alpha2-subgroup of the class Proteobacteria. Two serotypes are known: Houston-1 serotype and Marseille serotype . Its major vector is the cat flea ( Ctenocephalides felis ) [ 2 , 3 ]. Transmission to humans occurs via contaminated cats' claws and teeth, which gives it the name cat scratch disease. Normally Bartonella rapidly migrates from the blood into endothelial cells. There it causes vasculoproliferative lesions: by activation of inflammatory and proinflammatory cascades, it stimulates angiogenesis and the formation of new capillaries from old ones, leading to bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis [ 4 , 5 ]. Bacillary peliosis is a rare condition caused by B. henselae infections of the parenchymal vasculature, which results in development of cystic, blood filled spaces in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, or lymph nodes, but furthermore it can also cause abscess-like formations . Bone involvement is a rare phenomenon in CSD. The infection probably spreads via the haematogenous route, accounting for disseminated cases, and via the lymphatic route, for cases with limited extension . It is most frequently reported in children and young adults and normally presents as fever with lymphadenopathy in the draining site of a cat scratch or bite . 2. Presentation In early November 2014 an 18-year-old man presented to our department with fever above 40\\u00b0C, headaches, night sweats, and diffuse arthralgia for the last two weeks. Suspecting a bacterial infection with an unknown focus, he had been treated with ampicillin/sulbactam in a secondary care hospital for two weeks. The patient reported having been on a one-week holiday in Turkey three months ago. At the time of admission he was doing his military service. Before military service he lived at his parents' farm, where several different animal species are kept, including cattle, chicken, and cats. The full medical examination showed no abnormalities except bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory investigations revealed markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 11.41\\u2009mg/dL on day of admission. White blood count was within the normal range with 9.21 G/L. Differential blood count showed a decrease in lymphocyte count of 16%. Antimicrobial therapy was stopped and serial blood cultures, serologies for Entamoeba , Francisella tularensis , Brucella spp., and fungal, bacterial, and viral broad-spectrum PCRs were performed. All results were negative and did not provide evidence for a specific infectious pathogen. Similarly, QuantiFeron-TB test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed negative results and screening for autoimmune antibodies including rheumatoid factor, c-ANCA, and p-ANCA did not indicate autoimmune disease. Due to the patient's symptoms, such as fever and lymphadenopathy, and his inconclusive laboratory findings, a CT scan was performed, which showed multiple hypodense hepatic and splenic lesions; the largest is 2\\u2009cm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore subchondral sclerosis and erosion of the ventral thoracic spine were shown with maximal affection of the seventh vertebral body. Given the ambiguous structure of the spine, a MRI was done, confirming a ventral base plate fracture of vertebral body 7 with reduction in height of 20% and bone marrow edema (Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ). The lesions were suggestive for an underlying infectious origin as were the hepatosplenic lesions. Due to the radiological appearance, the stagnant infection parameters with negative serologies for Francisella tularensis , Brucella spp., Entamoeba , and blood cultures for common infectious pathogens, and the patient's history of residency on a farm with cats, serologic testing for B. henselae was performed. IgM (1\\u2009:\\u20091000) and IgG (1\\u2009:\\u200910.000) antibodies for B. henselae were highly elevated. Consequently, according to recently published guidelines , the diagnosis of an atypical presentation of visceral cat scratch disease with bone involvement was established. Consequently, regarding a histopathological examination of a cervical lymph node, we decided not to take a biopsy, to avoid potential risks involved with this procedure, especially since diagnosis could be established with the patient's clinical presentation, history, laboratory findings, and serology. A PCR for Bartonella henselae could not be performed, as this test is not available in our hospital. 3. Treatment and Follow-Up Intravenous antimicrobial treatment with azithromycin (1.5\\u2009g total dose) and rifampicin 300\\u2009mg twice daily for 3 weeks was administered and resulted in a rapid decrease of inflammation markers (CRP of 11.4\\u2009mg/dL to 1.32\\u2009mg/dL within one week). Further follow-up serology for B. henselae remained positive with IgM antibodies 1\\u2009:\\u20091000 two weeks after discharge. CRP was decreasing to 0.81\\u2009mg/dL at this point. One month after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, abdominal MRI revealed markedly reduced hepatic lesions with a maximum of 1.2\\u2009cm in diameter (Figures 5 and 6 ). 4. Differential Diagnosis Diagnosis of CSD is often challenging, as the pathogen is very slowly growing and therefore hardly detectable in blood cultures. Histopathology usually shows a granulomatous infection with an acellular, necrotic center and B. henselae can be identified with Warthin-Starry silver stain. Nevertheless, even in histopathological examination the diagnosis of B. henselae is often challenging. Only recently, PCR for B. henselae has become available in clinical routine; however sensitivity is often low. Therefore B. henselae specific serology is still the main diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) are the main diagnostic features in detection of B. henselae . Both show high sensitivity (88%) and high specificity (97%) [ 6 , 9 \\u2013 16 ]. But still, there is significant cross-reaction with B. quintana and in patients with recent EBV infection (IgM positive for EBV), IgM for B. henselae might be wrongly positive. If a recent infection with B. henselae is suspected in a patient with IgM antibodies against EBV, physicians are advised to check on elevated IgG antibodies for B. henselae . If those are elevated as well, the patient is highly suspicious for being infected with CSD . Nevertheless Brucellosis and Tularemia should be considered as differential diagnosis for patients presenting with symptoms as described above. Although both pathogens are very rare in Central Europe, even among military personnel, there should be a serologic testing for Tularemia and Brucellosis . Both diseases are zoonotic infections with a broad range of symptoms and should definitely be excluded before diagnosis of CSD can be established; therefore at least serologies for theses pathogens should be performed if specific PCRs should not be available. 5. Discussion This case report shows a very rare presentation of CSD and how difficult and time-consuming diagnosis may be. Only 10% of patients with B. henselae infection develop hepatic granuloma or splenic abscess [ 8 , 19 ]. Similarly, bone involvement is a rare phenomenon and only 0.27% of patients reportedly develop osteomyelitis. Similar to our case, bone localization most often affected is the vertebral column (42%), followed by the pelvic girdle (27%) . As suggested by Margileth we agree that, to establish the diagnosis of CSD, three of four of the following criteria should be present : Cat or flea contact regardless of the presence of an inoculation site lesion. Negative serology for other causes of lymphadenopathy; sterile pus aspirated from a node; a positive Bartonella PCR assay; and/or liver or spleen lesions seen on CT scan. Positive serology for B. henselae with a titer ratio of \\u22651\\u2009:\\u200964. Biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation consistent with CSD or a positive Warthin-Starry silver stain. This report underlines the importance of considering CSD as differential diagnosis in young patients with fever of unknown origin and lymphadenopathy . Furthermore this case illustrates that CSD may present atypically and that B. henselae specific serology may provide the decisive information to reliable establish the diagnosis of CSD.\",\n          \"Introduction The most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves\\u2019 disease (GD) is thyroid eye disease (TED) 1 observed in 25\\u201350% of the Graves\\u2019 patients. A total of 75% of the patients with thyrotoxicosis develop Graves\\u2019 ophthalmopathy (GO) within a year of diagnosis. 2 TED is an autoimmune disorder that can cause a rise in retrobulbar pressure and proptosis due to inflammation, swelling, and fibrosis of the extraocular muscle (EOM). It is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins targeting the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R), which can activate it and contribute to the development of TED. 3 In the majority of patients, both eyes are equally affected, although often in an asymmetric manner. 1 Unlike bilateral proptosis, which is mostly seen in thyroid disease, unilateral proptosis has a great variety of differential diagnoses, including orbital pseudotumor, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or intra-orbital neoplasms. 4 Unilateral ophthalmopathy mostly progresses to bilateral disease, while only 5\\u201311% of cases show no progression, making pure unilateral ophthalmopathy rare. 1 Here, we present the case of a young female with GD who developed unilateral proptosis without any visual disturbances. Case presentation A 25-year-old female presented to the outpatient department with a history of weight loss, menstrual irregularities, and occasional palpitations for 2 months. She had no history of night sweats, fever, chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath. She complained of bulging of her right eye, which was insidious in onset and gradually progressive without any difficulty in vision. There was no history of pain, discharge, redness, or trauma associated with her condition. She had no remarkable prior medical history nor any history of allergies to medication or other substances. She was a nonsmoker but consumed alcohol occasionally. At the time of her presentation to the hospital, she had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and a pulse rate of 125 beats/min. On ocular examination, her EOM movements were normal. The visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes, with a clinical severity score of 3/7, Hertel\\u2019s exophthalmometry of 23 mm in the right eye and 21 mm in the left eye. Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.6 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 7400/mm 3 with 57% neutrophils, 39% lymphocytes, and 3% monocytes. The free T3 level was 10.12 pmol/L (reference range: 3.10\\u20136.80), free T4 level was 25.88 pmol/L (reference range: 12.0\\u201322.0), TSH was 0.006 mIU/L (reference range: 0.27\\u20134.20), and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) was 3.56 IU/L (>1.75 (96% sensitivity and 99% specificity for GD)). The liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit revealed unilateral EOM enlargement and enhancement with tendon sparing and relative right proptosis ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. (a) Orbital axial and (b) orbital coronal; post-contrast MRI showing unilateral EOM enlargement and enhancement with tendon sparing and relative right proptosis. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; EOM: extraocular muscle. She was diagnosed with GD with GO and started on methimazole 5 mg twice daily with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg once weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 250 mg once weekly for 6 weeks for a total duration of 12 weeks. On follow-up after 3 months, she responded well to the medication, leading to the resolution of her eye symptoms. Discussion Our patient presents with proptosis, weight loss, menstrual irregularities, and palpitations, which are commonly seen in GD. However, our patients present with unilateral proptosis without any visual disturbances, and this is rare. GD is an autoimmune disorder that is more frequent between 20 and 50 years of age and occurs in 2% of women. 4 , 5 The annual incidence of GO is 16 per 100,000 women. 2 The symptoms of GO include a dry, gritty feeling in the eyes, photophobia, excessive tearing, double vision, and pressure feeling behind the eyes, as reported by nearly half of the patients of Graves\\u2019 hyperthyroidism. 6 The most typical symptoms of GO are proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, orbital congestion, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, conjunctival chemosis, difficulty moving eyes, eyelid retraction, and less frequently, compression of the optic nerve. 5 Proptosis can cause corneal exposure and injury in severe cases, especially if the lids fail to shut during sleep, and in most cases, there is subclinical involvement of the eyes. 6 The most widely accepted cause of Graves\\u2019 orbitopathy is the formation of autoantibodies against thyrotropin receptors located in both the thyroid gland and the orbit. This activates T cells, resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators. 7 Inflammatory cells and hyaluronans infiltrate the muscle, causing enlargement of the EOMs, an increase in the orbital fat volume, and ultimately, collagen deposition leading to fibrosis. 8 The disease often progresses via two distinct phases: an active, inflammatory phase followed by a static, non-inflammatory phase with fibrosis. 3 The risk factors for TED as smoking, older age, extreme physical or psychological stress, prior treatment with radioactive iodine, and increased titers of antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies are well described in published literature. 9 However, unilateral proptosis can be attributed to several factors, such as an asymmetrical distribution of antigens, anatomical variations in blood flow or lymphatic drainage, the elasticity of orbital septa, or other localized conditions. Infections or differences in the ability to generate adipose tissue can be a potential trigger for unilateral proptosis. 10 The onset of symptoms and unilateral proptosis involves a variety of alternate diagnoses including inflammatory, neoplastic, infectious, vascular, or neuromuscular conditions. 11 Orbital cellulitis is an acute condition that progresses rapidly. Orbital cellulitis mimics GO most frequently but may have a subacute onset over days or weeks, may be associated with pain, and involve any EOM, including the tendons, on MRI of the orbit. 11 The appearance of the extraocular eye muscles in MRI aids in differentiating TED from other conditions such as lymphoma and idiopathic orbital inflammation where the tendons are involved. 9 Neoplastic involvement was a consideration in our patient as it may present as a painless, restrictive eye involvement and occurs gradually over weeks or months, with or without a mass effect. 11 Lymphomas account for more than 50% of malignant orbital tumors in people 60 years and older, making them the most prevalent primary orbital tumors. 11 Computerized tomography (CT) of the orbit, MRI, and TRAb help diagnose GO. Orbital imaging is indicated in a patient with GO, particularly in a patient with unilateral proptosis. 5 In our patient, TRAb was positive with a rise in serum-free T3 and free T4 levels and a fall in TSH, suggesting GO and the high level of antithyroid peroxidase, which may indicate transient hyperthyroidism due to Hashitoxicosis. 12 The TRAb and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor antibodies could have contributed to the pathogenesis of infiltrative ophthalmopathy. 2 Corticosteroids are usually used in the treatment of GO due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. 13 Methimazole is an antithyroid medication for GD but does not directly affect extrathyroidal manifestations like GO. Our patient improved with combined therapy of corticosteroids and antithyroid medications. Reported cases of unilateral proptosis in GO are shown in Table 1 . Among the reported cases, four of them were euthyroid GD and two were hyperthyroid GD with subsequent eye symptoms. Our case reveals unilateral proptosis in hyperthyroid GD with no eye symptoms.

Conclusion This clinical case is a diagnostic challenge because the true unilateral disease is rare, and bilateral asymmetric eye involvement is seen in GO. Numerous differential diagnoses should be considered and studied before diagnosing this uncommon entity, even though noticeable unilateral proptosis supports the atypical presentation of GO in GD. The patient\\u2019s response to treatment medications suggests that timely therapy is crucial for reversing the ocular manifestation of TED.\",\n          \"1 INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID\\u201019) is an emerging infectious disease that manifests with varying symptoms such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. 1 Reports have shown that fever is the most common symptom, appearing in approximately 90% of the reported cases. However, the natural history and progression of fever due to COVID\\u201019 have not been fully understood. 2 Here, we present the case of a COVID\\u201019 patient exhibiting heatstroke\\u2010like symptoms. There are no published reports demonstrating an association between COVID\\u201019 and heatstroke or supporting proactive body temperature regulation; hence, this case report may contribute to understanding COVID\\u201019 pathology and its treatment. 2 CASE HISTORY A 47\\u2010year\\u2010old man presented with a 4\\u2010day history of fever and dyspnea. Two days before hospitalization, he tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, assessed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. He also had a 5\\u2010year history of untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus. On admission, his hemoglobin A1c level was 13%. He reported having no prior contact with other COVID\\u201019 patients. The patient presented to the hospital with a body temperature of 38.3\\u00b0C, heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 132/83\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 93% on ambient air. Chest computed tomography revealed ground\\u2010glass opacities and bilateral patchy shadows consistent with those of COVID\\u201019 pneumonia. On the second day of hospitalization, the patient's respiratory condition worsened; hence, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where oral intubation was initiated to provide artificial respiration. The patient had remittent fever, with a temperature ranging from 37.5\\u00b0C to 40.4\\u00b0C, on hospitalization days 6\\u20108. On day 9, he developed sustained fever, with a temperature of 40\\u00b0C to 41\\u00b0C (Figure 1 ), for which acetaminophen was ineffective. This was accompanied by a marked disturbance in consciousness. His systolic blood pressure dropped below 70\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg, leading to warm shock. Respiratory condition further deteriorated on the night of day 9, with the partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio decreasing from 202\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg to 140\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg. Large\\u2010volume infusion of fluids was started along with the administration of vasopressors (noradrenaline, vasopressin, and adrenaline) and hydrocortisone. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA\\u2010ECMO) was initiated on the night of day 9 itself owing to worsening hemodynamics. Laboratory results (Table 1 ) revealed lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic dysfunction, and significant rhabdomyolysis. After the initiation of VA\\u2010ECMO, the patient's sustained fever was rapidly alleviated, and the symptoms of multiorgan failure also began to improve gradually. VA\\u2010ECMO support was withdrawn on day 22. Life\\u2010prolonging treatment was withheld because of repeated severe cerebral infarction and hemorrhage that led to central nervous system damage. The patient died on day 30. Although favipiravir was administered to treat the patient's infection from the day 1 of his admission to the ICU, it was discontinued on day 7 because of the possibility of drug\\u2010induced rhabdomyolysis. Broad\\u2010spectrum antibiotics were administered from the day he was admitted to the ICU to prevent secondary bacterial infections.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 3 DISCUSSION We describe the case of a 47\\u2010year\\u2010old man positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented with a 4\\u2010day history of fever and dyspnea. His chest computed tomography findings were consistent with those of COVID\\u201019 pneumonia; laboratory test results and clinical findings revealed multiorgan failure and extremely elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. The proportion of CK\\u2010MB was not high; thus, we did not suggest heart diseases. However, several other differential diagnoses, such as malignant hyperthermia, malignant syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis, were thought of causing severe CK elevation. As the patient was not taking any volatile anesthetic (eg, halothane,\\u00a0isoflurane,\\u00a0sevoflurane,\\u00a0desflurane),\\u00a0succinylcholine, or antipsychotic drugs, malignant hyperthermia and malignant syndrome were ruled out. However, the CK elevation was later thought to be a symptom of rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, his initially remittent fever later developed into the sustained type, a sequela that has not yet been associated with previous COVID\\u201019 cases. Furthermore, altered consciousness, multiorgan failure, and extreme hyperthermia with a temperature >40.5\\u00b0C are symptoms consistent with heatstroke. 3 In addition, the patient had a 5\\u2010year history of untreated diabetes mellitus that could have had a role in the disease course and outcome of the patient, which should be investigated in subsequent similar reports. In addition to these findings, the symptoms of multiorgan failure began to show signs of improvement upon regulation of the body temperature using VA\\u2010ECMO. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may have been caused by heat stress. In the case of heatstroke, oxidative phosphorylation becomes uncoupled because of extreme hyperthermia and a variety of enzymes cease to function. A cytokine\\u2010mediated systemic inflammatory response develops, and the production of heat\\u2010shock proteins is increased. Blood is shunted from the splanchnic circulation to the skin and muscles, resulting in gastrointestinal ischemia and an increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa. Hepatocytes, vascular endothelium, and neural tissue are most sensitive to increased core temperatures, but all organs may ultimately be involved. Typical symptoms of heatstroke are a rectal core temperature of 105\\u00b0F (40.6\\u00b0C) or greater, multiorgan damage, and central nervous dysfunction, 4 and in severe cases, circulation failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation are found. 5 His clinical symptoms are consistent with heatstroke, but the absence of environmental factors that could have caused this condition makes proving an association between this case and heatstroke difficult. We thought that the heat dissipation mechanism could be disrupted by COVID\\u201019, which caused prolonged hyperthermia and acute physiological alterations such as circulatory failure, hypoxemia, and increased metabolic demands, and direct heat\\u2010related cytotoxic effects could escalate, causing multiorgan failure. Despite all this, it must be noted that fever has beneficial effects, such as strengthening the immune response. 6 Proactive core body temperature regulation such as using extracorporeal apparatus is usually not conducted for hyperthermia but should be considered in cases of COVID\\u201019. 4 CONCLUSION While there are no clear indications for body temperature control during viral infections such as COVID\\u201019, if heat stress caused by COVID\\u201019 leads to organ failure, then proactive body temperature regulation may be an effective treatment option. This report may help in understanding COVID\\u201019 pathology and treatment better owing to the possible demonstration of an association between COVID\\u201019 and heatstroke.

He was currently in military service. \\n\\nOn examination, he was febrile with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and otherwise unremarkable vital signs. Laboratory studies showed a C-reactive protein level of 11.41 mg/dL, a white-cell count of 9.21 G/L with lymphopenia (16%), and normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. Ampicillin/sulbactam was discontinued and serial blood cultures; serologic testing for Entamoeba, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella spp.; broad-spectrum fungal, bacterial, and viral PCRs; and a QuantiFeron-TB test were all negative.

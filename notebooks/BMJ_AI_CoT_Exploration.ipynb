\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mher viral load is undetectable now suggests ART is effective, but the immune system's reaction is causing a \u001b[0m

maybe a different infection?\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mThe BAL didn't show other \u001b[0m  \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197morganisms, and cultures are negative.\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mThe high P. jirovecii in BAL is still present, but the features like \u001b[0m     \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m

\u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mSince the treatment for IRIS would be managing the inflammation, maybe steroids, but she's already on \u001b[0m          \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m

\u001b[30;48;2;197;229;255mSo \u001b[0m   \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;197;229;255mthe most likely diagnosis here is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia complicated by Immune

\u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mThe original pathogen (PCP) is still present, \u001b[0m  \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mbut the symptoms don't fit a new infection because the cultures are negative for others.\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mAlso, she's on ART \u001b[0m    \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mnow, so immune recovery is happening.\u001b[0m \u001b[30;48;2;229;255;197mThe clinical picture fits IRIS more than a new infection or drug-induced \u001b[0m \u001b[34m│\u001b[0m\n\u001b[34m│\u001b[0m

His white blood cell count and C‐reactive protein level were normal. Noncontrast and contrast‐enhanced CT of the brain showed no fluid collection. Lumbar puncture revealed 253 leukocytes/µL (65% polymorphonuclear) without organism growth; blood cultures were sterile. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole, but fevers persisted despite broad‐spectrum coverage. On hospital day 14, with persistent fevers and a suspicion that his bone flap was infected, he underwent reopening of the posterior fossa craniotomy wound and removal of the bone flap. The procedure was confined to the extradural compartment, although there was intraoperative CSF loss. Bone‐flap cultures and PCR were negative for infection. After surgery, he developed bilateral lower‐motor‐neuron facial weakness (House–Brackmann grade 4 bilaterally), mild slurred speech, and a left abducens nerve palsy. Limb strength, reflexes, and sensation were normal; gait was moderately ataxic.

His white blood cell count and C‐reactive protein level were normal. Noncontrast and contrast‐enhanced CT of the brain showed no fluid collection. Lumbar puncture revealed 253 leukocytes/µL (65% polymorphonuclear) without organism growth; blood cultures were sterile. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole, but fevers persisted despite broad‐spectrum coverage. On hospital day 14, with persistent fevers and a suspicion that his bone flap was infected, he underwent reopening of the posterior fossa craniotomy wound and removal of the bone flap. The procedure was confined to the extradural compartment, although there was intraoperative CSF loss. Bone‐flap cultures and PCR were negative for infection. After surgery, he developed bilateral lower‐motor‐neuron facial weakness (House–Brackmann grade 4 bilaterally), mild slurred speech, and a left abducens nerve palsy. Limb strength, reflexes, and sensation were normal; gait was moderately ataxic.

Infectious cause excluded — “No infective aetiology was detected.”  <br>2. Broad structural causes (congenital, traumatic, neoplastic) considered — “Treating physicians must out rule congenital, traumatic, infective and neoplastic causation.”  <br>3. Traction injury from CSF leak considered — “CSF drainage during the surgery may be considered one possible mechanism for development of his postoperative cranial nerve palsies.”  <br>4. Vascular hypoperfusion considered — “The same traction forces may result in impairment of the blood supply to the facial nerve…with subsequent hypoperfusion.”  <br>5. Direct compression at the pontomedullary junction considered and excluded by imaging — “Direct compression of the facial and abducens nerves…but there was no imaging evidence of this on the MRI scans.”\n        </div>\n        <h4>Verification Explanation:</h4>\n        <div style='padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;'>\n            While both conditions involve post-surgical neurological symptoms, 'Posterior Fossa Syndrome' and 'Postoperative cranial nerve palsy' are distinct diagnoses. The true diagnosis specifically refers to the cranial nerve deficits (facial and abducens nerve palsies) that occurred after the surgery, while Posterior Fossa Syndrome is a broader condition with additional features.

The family history suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance since the father has similar findings.\\n\\nKey features include:\\n- Skeletal abnormalities: clavicular hypoplasia, scoliosis, pelvic abnormalities, coxa vara, slender long bones.\\n- Craniofacial abnormalities: frontal bossing, hypertelorism, mid-face deficiency, high-arched palate, dental anomalies (impacted and over-retained teeth).\\n- Wormian bones in the skull.\\n- Normal intelligence.\\n\\nThis sounds familiar. Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) comes to mind. Let me verify if it matches.\\n\\nCleidocranial dysplasia is characterized by:\\n- Hypoplasia or aplasia of clavicles (leading to drooping shoulders).\\n- Delayed closure of fontanelles and cranial sutures with wormian bones.\\n- Dental anomalies: supernumerary teeth, delayed eruption, over-retained deciduous teeth.\\n- Short stature.\\n- Other skeletal features: coxa vara, pelvic abnormalities, slender bones.\\n\\nYes, that seems to fit. The facial features like frontal bossing and mid-face deficiency are also common in CCD. Intelligence is usually normal in CCD, which matches here.\\n\\nLet me double-check if there's any other condition that might fit. For example, osteogenesis imperfecta can have wormian bones and bone fragility, but the clavicular hypoplasia and dental anomalies are more specific to CCD. Also, in osteogenesis imperfecta, there might be bone fractures, which aren't mentioned here.\\n\\nAnother condition is pyknodysostosis, but that involves osteosclerosis and short stature, but not typically clavicular hypoplasia or the same dental issues.\\n\\nSo, cleidocranial dysplasia seems the most likely.\\n\\nThe output should be just the name of the disease within the <answer> tags.\\n\\nTherefore, the final diagnosis is Cleidocranial Dysplasia.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"verification_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"y\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

PAM is prevalent among family units with high rates of consanguinity among parents of affected individuals. Mutations in the SCL34A2 gene that encodes for a sodium-phosphate type-IIb transporter protein, expressed in alveolar type II cells leads to the formation of extensive pulmonary intra-alveolar microliths . PAM is often discovered incidentally by chest radiographs obtained for other purposes during early adulthood . The disease presentation is distinctively characterized by mild clinical symptoms at time of diagnosis, and an out of proportion pathognomonic radiographic lung parenchymal involvement. PAM is rarely associated with extrapulmonary or cardiac involvement . Herein, we report the case of a 45-year-old Jordanian man with extensive familial PAM and tricuspid valve calcification. This case study was performed and is being reported in line with the CARE criteria. 2 Presentation of case A 45-year-old male patient presented to our center with progressive shortness of breath and dry cough. He had a history of frequent admissions to other hospitals with similar complaints over the past 3 months. He denied any history of fever. He was a heavy smoker with more than 90 pack\\u2013years history of smoking. He also worked with concrete and asphalt road construction for more than 15 years. There was no history of exposure to organic dust. On physical examination, he was tachypneic and chest examination revealed diminished breath sounds with bilateral early inspiratory crackles. He had no finger clubbing. Arterial blood gases, on room air at rest, showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 55\\u00a0mmHg, PaO2 49\\u00a0mmHg, HCO3 35 mmol/L and SpO2 86.6%. He had normal white blood cells counts with hemoglobin of 14.3 g/dl and the rest of his laboratory workup including comprehensive metabolic profile and liver enzymes were within normal range. CRP and ESR were within normal range. Admission chest radiograph showed bilateral calcific reticulonodular shadowing more prominent in the lower and middle zones with emphysematous changes seen in the in bilateral upper lobes ( Fig. 1 ). High resolution CT scan of the chest revealed diffuse alveolar and interlobular septal prominent calcifications with the characteristic \\u201csnowstorm\\u201d appearance consistent with PAM with superimposed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with middle to lower zones predominance and sparing the subpleural spaces ( Fig. 2 ). A Tc-99\\u00a0m HDP whole-body bone scan revealed increased radiotracer activity in the middle and lower zones of both lungs with no evidence of abnormal focal increased uptake elsewhere ( Fig. 3 ). Echocardiography demonstrated calcifications covering the tricuspid valve with elevated right ventricular systolic pressure at 70\\u00a0mmHg with 2nd degree mitral regurgitation. There was minimal pericardial effusion. Atrial and ventricular dimensions were within normal range with no evidence of diastolic dysfunction, and estimated ejection fraction of 57% ( Video 1 ). Fig. 1 Chest x-ray with bilateral reticulonodular shadowing. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 High-resolution CT scan of the chest showing the classical crazy-paving appearance of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Tc-99 m HD whole body bone scan revealed diffuse increased radiotracer activity in the mid and lower zones of both lungs. Fig. 3 Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.05.039 The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Video 1: Echocardiography indicating the presence of tricuspid valvular calcifications. Patient recalled a routine chest radiography he had as part of fitness assessment for military enlistment during his early adulthood and was told to have a pattern of reticulonodular abnormality in both lung fields. He never sought medical attention as he had no respiratory complaints except for minimal exertional dyspnea to strenuous and vigorous activities. His parents are close relatives. He had 11 sisters and 2 brothers. He reported having two sisters with similar illnesses and chest radiographic abnormalities, one died at the age of 38 years from respiratory failure and the other was 42-year-old and still alive and was diagnosed with PAM. The patient and his mother, reported at least 35 close relatives known to have PAM. During his hospitalization, he was given a course of IV systemic steroids and supplemental oxygen therapy in addition to bronchodilators with minimal improvement. After counseling with the patient, he was discharged home on supplemental home oxygen therapy at 2 L/minutes at rest and 4 L/minutes during sleep and exertions and to be referred for lung transplant evaluation. Unfortunately, few days after discharge, he died at home. 3 Discussion PAM is a rare autosomal recessive, genetic disease. Since it was first described almost 150 years ago, about 1200 cases have been reported worldwide. It was first described by Friedrich in 1856, and in 1918, Harbitz provided an accurate radiological description. PAM is characterized by the presence of numerous tiny calculi (calcospherites) and calcifications within the alveolar spaces. The age at time of presentation ranges between 30 and 50 years. Inactivating Mutations of the Solute-Carrier-family-34 (sodium phosphate) member-2 (SCL34A2) gene, which encodes a type IIb sodium phosphate cotransporter, were proved to be responsible for this disease. The mutation leads to reduced phosphate reuptake by type IIb sodium phosphate transporter in the apical membrane of type-II alveolar cells, resulting in intra-alveolar calcium phosphate chelation and microlith formation [ 1 , 2 ]. Sporadic and familial cases of PAM are reported. Male predominance was reported in sporadic cases. Familial cases account for nearly 30\\u201350% of reported cases and is highly associated with consanguinity with no gender predilection seen. Most of the cases are coming from Europe (42.7%) and Asia (40.6%) [ 2 , 4 ]. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the highest cluster of at least 35 cases of PAM coming from the same family in Jordan, with a high rate of consanguineous marriages reported among them. Similar to the presentation of our case, in contrast to the radiological findings, which are often severe, the majority of patients with PAM are remarkably asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and the disease is usually identified incidentally following radiographic examination of the chest for other purposes. This clinico-radiological dissociation is the hallmark of the presentation of PAM. Shortness of breath is the most common symptom in symptomatic patients followed by a dry cough and chest pain. Smoking and infection may accelerate disease progression, but PAM usually has slow course of progression, producing incremental exertional dyspnea with desaturation in young adulthood, and respiratory insufficiency by late middle age. Physical examination may reveal rales and finger clubbing . On chest radiograph, numerous sand-like microliths are seen diffusely scattered, predominantly in the lower two-thirds of the both lungs, obscuring the diaphragmatic, mediastinal, and cardiac borders. The propensity of the disease for the lung bases is probably due to the larger volume and rich blood supply of the lower lobes. Emphysematous bullae may be present in the lung apices, as well as a zone of hyperlucency between the lung parenchyma and the ribs, known as a \\u201cblack pleural-line\\u201d . High resolution CT scan of the chest shows numerous sandstorm-like intra-alveolar calcifications (microliths) throughout the lungs with subpleural and peribronchial distribution, along with ground-glass opacities. The classic \\u201cSandstorm\\u201d appearance with predominance of the middle and even more in the lower lung areas, is the typical radiological presentation of PAM . Differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary calcifications on CT or chest radiograph includes healed varicella pneumonia, miliary tuberculosis, Aspirated or extravasated contrast material, hyperparathyroidism, pulmonary amyloidosis, hypervitaminosis D, Paget disease, metastatic calcifications associated with chronic renal failure, and occupational lung disease such as silicosis [ 1 , 2 ]. Bone scintigraphy using technetium-99\\u00a0m labeled diphosphonate compounds have affinity for calcification foci at soft tissue and can detect early pulmonary calcification . Although histopathological diagnosis is done by either open lung or transbronchial biopsy showing intra-alveolar laminated calcium phosphate concretions , many authors argue that typical radiological pattern is considered pathognomonic for PAM and precludes the need for a lung biopsy in most cases. In our case, PAM diagnosis was based on the clinical and characteristic radiographic presentation as our patient refused to undergo tissue biopsy to confirm diagnosis. SLC34A2 is chiefly expressed in alveolar type-II cells, but is also expressed in other epithelial tissues, including mammary glands, the small intestine, kidneys, pancreas, ovaries, liver, testes, placenta, and prostate. Rare extrapulmonary calcifications can result in testicular atrophy, obstructive azoospermia, medullary nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis . Microlith deposits outside the lungs are thought to be associated with the penetrance of mutations of the SLC34A2 gene [ 9 , 10 ]. Cardiac involvement has been described in few cases of PAM. Pericardial calcification [ 11 , 12 ], pulmonary hypertension and cor-pulmonale have been described [ 13 , 14 ]. Four cases with mitral stenosis were reported in the literature, of whom one also had aortic stenosis [ 15 , 16 ]. Although type-II sodium/phosphate co-transporter has been recently identified in a human aortic valve , concomitant aortic valvular calcification was reported in only 2 cases. One of the cases had an advanced PAM in otherwise healthy individual, in addition to cholelithiasis and idiopathic medullary nephrocalcinosis . The other case was in a renal transplant recipient with PAM, who was described to have mitral and aortic valve calcifications . To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first case of PAM with tricuspid valvular calcification. Furthermore, in contrast to previously reported cases of PAM with valvular involvement, transthoracic echocardiogram in our case has shown calcification deposit involving the tricuspid valve with concomitant regurgitation rather than stenosis. The overall prognosis of PAM is poor with slow progression to eventually respiratory failure and cor-pulmonale. Death typically occurs 10\\u201315 years after diagnosis . There is no known effective therapy and treatment remains mainly supportive. Various therapies have been tried including therapeutic bronchoscopic lavage, systemic and inhaled steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and bisphosphonate (disodium etidronate) without benefits in slowing down the progressive course of the disease. For patients with end-stage PAM disease, lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment . After PAM is diagnosed in a given patient, family members should be screened by chest radiography, and parents should be counseled that future children are also at risk of developing the disease. 4 Conclusion PAM is a rare hereditary parenchymal lung disease that is prevalent among families with a high rate of consanguinity. It is a fatal, slowly progressive disease characterized by clinical-radiological dissociation. Extrapulmonary calcifications with valvular heart involvement is very rare. This could be due to a variability in the penetrance of SLC34IIb mutation. Further genetic investigation among families with PAM may aide in early detection of the disease and better understanding of the disease genetic characteristics and pathogenesis for future development of a specific targeted genetic therapy.

These include the 2 terminal branches of the sciatic nerve, the popliteal vessels and the short saphenous vein. Several muscles of the thigh and leg form the anatomic boundaries of the popliteal fossa. These include the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and popliteus muscles. The popliteus muscle originates from the lateral surface of the lateral condyle of the femur its fibers pass downward and medially. It inserts onto the posterior surface of tibia, above the soleal line. The muscle arises within the capsule of knee joint and its tendon separates the lateral meniscus from the lateral ligament of the joint . Its muscular fibers originate from the medial side just posterior to the medial lateral ligament and the semimembranous tendon to which the fibers are strictly connected. These fibers end in a complex aponeurotic structure that we divide here into 3 sections (capsular, meniscal, fibular) and in a strong tendon. The aponeurotic structure is very important, and knowledge about it allows us to understand the original function of the popliteus muscle. The popliteus muscle is supplied by the tibial nerve, from spinal roots L5 and S1. This muscle plays an important role in the coordinating gait by initiating flexion of the fully extended knee and is the main stabilizer of the dorsal knee region. Case report A 24-year-old male patient presented with an episode of acute pain in the left knee and inability to flex it. His history was significant for the lack of any triggers, including a traumatic event. He underwent an MRI scan (Philips 1.5 T) that demonstrated an accessory popliteus muscle ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 ) in addition to the absence of popliteomeniscal fascicules (PMFs) pathology\\n\\n. Fig. 1 Magnetic Resonance (MRI) of the left knee. Axial TSE T1-weighted (w) image (a) and axial TSE T2-w (b) MRI images, demonstrate the accessory popliteus muscle (arrow). Fig 1 Fig. 2 MRI of the left knee. Sagittal TSE T2w images at 2 different level lateral (a) and more medial (b) demonstrate the accessory popliteus muscle (black arrow) with course in the deep popliteal fossa and its insertion (white arrow) at the level of the posteromedial articular capsule. (c)MRI of the right knee. Sagittal TSE T2w image of the controlateral side shows no evidence of accessory popliteus muscle. Fig 2 Fig. 3 MRI of the left knee. Coronal Gradient Echo T2-w image, demonstrates the accessory popliteus muscle (arrow) originating from the medial side of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Note its similar inferomedial course of the normal popliteus muscle (black circle). Fig 3 The clinical examination did not reveal any evidence of a palpable lesion in the popliteal fossa. An ultrasound with Doppler revealed patent popliteal vessels without any evidence of thrombosis or flow abnormalities; in addition to normal structural muscles lacking evidence of injury. An electroneurography examination of the posterior tibial, peroneal, and sural nerves was performed and it showed normal latency, amplitude and conduction velocities of the nerves. These findings excluded a painful compressive neuropathy as a probable cause of symptoms. Furthermore, the patient underwent a lumbar MRI which revealed no pathologic causes for the symptoms such as nerve root compression, masses, spinal cord compression or disc herniations. The needle examination was also normal in left gastrocnemius, which is the most important muscle innervated by posterior tibial nerve. T2 TSE sequences in axial and sagittal planes, T1 TSE in axial plane and gradient T2 ECHO in coronal plane of the knee were obtained. The clinical suspicion of meniscal or cartilaginous lesions was excluded and the analysis of the muscular structures of the popliteal fossa showed the presence of an accessory popliteal muscle. This extra muscle has origin immediately close the lateral gastrocnemius muscle from the top of lateral condyle and continues, in deep popliteal fossa, towards the medial femorotibial compartment and it inserts at the level of the posteromedial articular capsule. An additional MRI examination of the contralateral knee revealed no accessory popliteal muscle in the right knee ( Fig.2c ). Discussion Over the years, the radiologic presence of accessory muscles in various parts of the body was described. In most cases these findings were incidental in patients lacking clinical symptoms. More specifically, at the level of the popliteal fossa, accessory slips of the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, as well as the tensor fasciae suralis muscle, and the accessory semimembranosus muscle may rarely occur. Reports in the literature have shown that abnormal origins and accessory slips of the medial or lateral heads of the gastrocnemius may cause entrapment of the popliteal artery\\n\\nand, rarely, the 3rd head of the gastrocnemius and can be associated with nerve entrapment causing severe knee pain\\n\\n. In our case the accessory popliteus has a common origin with the lateral head of the gastrocnemius, courses anterior to the popliteal vessels, and inserts on the posteromedial knee joint capsule\\n\\n. An accessory muscle termed the accessory popliteus has also been described in the radiology Literature. the authors postulated that the proximity of the muscle to the neurovascular bundle might result in compressive symptoms\\n\\n. However, no direct evidence linking its presence of the development of knee pain has benn described to our knowledge. In most cases the patient has no symptoms, and the diagnosis is purely casual and concomitant with a different knee pathology with various non specific symptoms. For this reason, we studied the VC (Velocity conduction) and the muscular responses of the most important nerves of the leg, to evaluate paresthesia-like and pain symptoms. The results of the electromyographic and electroneurographic examination did not identify nerve abnormalities and the echo color doppler examination excluded compression of the Popliteal artery. Given all the normal vascular, muscular, and nerve findings, the cause of the left knee pain was attributed to the presence of the accessory popliteus muscle and the patient was sent to the attention of the orthopedic surgeon. Finally, reports have described the presence of bilateral accessory popliteal muscle in the same patient with an identical proximal and distal insertion and course in the popliteal fossa\\n\\n.As such, an additional MR examination of the contralateral knee was performed and the exam revealed the absence of the accessory popliteus muscle in the contralateral knee, demonstrating that in our patient, this was a unilateral finding. Taken together, this case report describes the presence of a unilateral accessory popliteal muscle which can present as an acute symptomatic knee pain and limit its range. This should be considered on the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute knee pain after the common causes are ruled out.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis, increases the expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on human platelets, which effects the prothrombotic impact of cannabis. Introduction Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent diseases of the elderly population. 1 Although treatment of patients with CAD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is part of clinical routine, ACS in young patients can be challenging due to a wide range of causing differential diagnoses. 2\\u20137 We report on a 21-year-old man suffering from recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) on persistent cannabis consumption. Timeline Date Event Treatment September 2017 Presentation with chest pain and ST-segment elevation immediately after cannabis consumption. Thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was diagnosed Thrombus aspiration, infusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) and drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation May 2018 Thrombotic occlusion of a diagonal branch despite optimal adaption of the previously implanted stent (still using cannabis) Infusion of GPI and DES implantation February 2019 Thrombotic re-occlusion of the diagonal branch after 1 year of event-free survival despite optimal adaption of the previously implanted stent (still using cannabis) GPI alone March 2019 Thrombotic occlusion of the ramus circumflexus was found (still using cannabis) GPI alone Case presentation In September 2017, a 21-year-old male patient was referred to our emergency room with constant substernal chest tightness, unrelated to breathing, with radiation into the left shoulder, lasting for 2 h before admission. Physical examination was unremarkable; there were no additional heart sounds on auscultation and no pulmonary rales. The heart rate was 67 b.p.m. and blood pressure 130/75\\u2009mmHg. Jugular venous pressure was not elevated and no pitting oedema was present. On electrocardiogram (ECG), sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and in leads II, III, and aVF was noted ( Figure\\u00a01A ). Laboratory measurements showed elevation of the cardiac biomarkers troponin (0.239\\u2009ng/mL; upper limit of normal <0.1\\u2009ng/mL) and creatine kinase (initial 469\\u2009U/L, peak 1563\\u2009U/L; upper limit of normal <169\\u2009U/L). Treatment with aspirin 250\\u2009mg intravenously was initiated, a heparin infusion started and a loading dose of 180\\u2009mg ticagrelor administered. Subsequent coronary angiography showed thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) at the take-off of the first diagonal branch ( Figure 1B ; Supplementary material online, Video S2 ). No other lesions were observed and the remaining coronary arteries did not show any atherosclerotic alterations ( Supplementary material online, Video S1 ). Because coronary blood flow could not be fully re-established by thrombus aspiration ( Supplementary material online, Video S3 ) and infusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI), implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES; 4.0 \\u00d7 18\\u2009mm) was necessary after pre-dilatation of the lesion ( Figure 1C and D , Supplementary material online, Videos S4 and S5 ). During intervention, we used a FilterWire EZ\\u2122-system (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) to protect the peripheral vessels from thrombotic occlusion ( Supplementary material online, Videos S4 and S5 , Figure\\u00a01 ). The culprit lesion was reopened successfully and TIMI III flow could be established ( Figure\\u00a01E , Supplementary material online, Video S6 ). The culprit lesion was reopened successfully ( Figure\\u00a01E , Supplementary material online, Video S6 ). No periprocedural arrhythmias occurred and the patient recovered quickly. Dual antiplatelet therapy (100\\u2009mg aspirin once daily and 90\\u2009mg ticagrelor twice daily), a betablocker (47.5\\u2009mg metoprolol once daily), and a statin (40\\u2009mg atorvastatin once daily) were prescribed. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed hypokinesia of the anterior wall resulting in overall mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction but no other abnormalities. Figure 1 ( A ) Twelve-channel electrocardiogram showing distinct ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads and in II, III, and aVF. ( B \\u2013 E ) Coronary angiography (left anterior oblique caudal projection) indicating subtotal stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (white arrow in B ). Using a FilterWire EZ\\u2122-system (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) to protect the peripheral vessels (white arrowhead in C ) dilatation and drug-eluting stent implantation (black arrow in C and D ) were performed to recover blood flow ( E ). A guide wire was placed in the first diagonal branch for sidebranch protection. The left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery (not shown) were normal in angiographic appearance. To rule out an embolic source for the thrombotic coronary occlusion in this young patient, we additionally performed transoesophageal echocardiography with echo contrast but could not find any evidence for an intracardiac shunt or any other source of cardiac embolism. Moreover, laboratory testing for thrombophilia did not show any abnormalities and testing for autoimmune diseases was negative. Blood lipid and glucose levels were within the normal range. The patient had a history of frequent cannabis abuse but denied cigarette smoking. He had no family history of CAD and did not regularly take any medication. Urine toxicology revealed elevated levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol but was negative for any other drugs. Thus, we considered cannabis abuse as the most likely cause of the MI and strictly advised the patient to avoid further cannabis consumption. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good clinical status under optimal medical treatment. However, the patient continued his cannabis abuse and suffered from three ACS relapses within 2 years, although medication was continued. The first MI occurred 8\\u2009months later and was caused by thrombotic occlusion of a diagonal branch despite optimal adaptation of the previously implanted stent in the LAD which was visualized by optical coherence tomography ( Figure 2A \\u2013 C ). This occlusion was treated by GPI and implantation of another DES into the diagonal branch ( Figure 2D \\u2013 F ). The second relapse was a non-ST elevation ACS in February 2019 and was due to thrombotic re-occlusion of the diagonal branch, again despite optimal stent adaptation. One month later, the patient again presented with angina at rest, this time without cardiac enzyme release, caused by thrombotic occlusion of the proximal circumflex artery. Both events were treated by GPI alone. Coronary angiography did not reveal any evidence of coronary dissection in any of the ACS relapses. Cannabis consumption was continued during the whole period. After the fourth ACS, left ventricular ejection fraction was still only mildly reduced. Since the last relapse, the patient stopped cannabis abuse and has been symptom-free for 8\\u2009months, i.e. until the last follow-up in November 2019. Figure 2 Imaging of the thrombotic occlusion of the first diagonal branch (black arrow in A ) 8\\u2009months after the first event. ( B ) Thrombus visualization (white arrow) with optical coherence tomography in the diagonal branch. ( C ) The previously implanted stent in the left anterior descending artery was well-adapted (white arrowheads). After balloon dilatation ( D ) implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the diagonal branch was performed using the \\u2018kissing-balloon\\u2019 technique ( E ). Coronary blood flow could be fully re-established ( F ). Discussion This case highlights an unusual cause for the overall rare occurrence of an ACS in young patients. In the fourth universal definition of MI consensus document by the European Society of Cardiology, MI was defined as myocardial injury with elevation of cardiac biomarkers and evidence of myocardial ischaemia indicated by ECG changes, specific symptoms or evidence of myocardial damage in imaging. 1 Myocardial infarction can be caused by either plaque rupture/erosion (Type 1), usually affecting patients with underlying CAD, or by an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand (Type 2), which often includes young patients with other aetiologies of MI 1 . In contrast to ACS in the elderly population, MI is rarely caused by plaque rupture with underlying CAD in young patients unless a certain number of cardiovascular risk factors are already present. 2 Differential diagnosis of ACS in the younger population is challenging due to a high number of potential and rare aetiologies. There is limited evidence how to effectively assess the cause of MI in younger patients and knowledge is based on a few case series only. 2\\u20138 Table 1 summarizes diseases that have been implicated as causative factors for an ACS in young patients. Thus, in a young patient presenting with ACS a thorough investigation for potential causes of MI is mandatory to enable adequate treatment of the underlying disease and improve prognosis. Careful patient history and physical examination often help to limit differential diagnoses and reach the correct diagnosis. Table 1 Underlying diseases and findings in patient history and physical examination for differential diagnoses of premature myocardial infarction Underlying disease Findings in patient history and physical examination Anomalous coronary artery 9 Prior syncope Autoimmune and vasculitis 8 Skin abnormalities, involvement of other organs Vasospasm 10 Often female, anamnesis of smoking, drugs Cardiomyopathies (e.g. takotsubo 11 ) Positive/negative stress Coronary endothelial dysfunction 2 Presence of several cardiovascular risk factors Embolism 12 Atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale Intoxications (e.g. amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine) 3 Anamnesis, conspicuous mental state Myocarditis 13 Fever, myalgia Sickle cell disease 14 Country of origin Spontaneous aortic or coronary artery dissection 15 History of Marfan syndrome or Syphilis, malperfusion of organs or limbs, pregnancy Thrombophilia 16 Family history Our report underlines that cannabis-induced MI should be considered as a rare cause of ACS in young adults. This is emphasized by the fact that the patient was free of events since he stopped cannabis consumption, although there is still a chance that the patient may develop similar symptoms without association to recent cannabis abuse in the future. Three mechanisms of cannabis-associated ACS have been reported in the literature: coronary vasospasm, thrombus formation, and coronary artery dissection. 10\\u201312 In the case presented coronary angiography revealed coronary thrombosis without any evidence for vasospasm or dissection. Therefore, calcium channel blockers or nitrates were not used in this specific circumstance. A prothrombotic effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis, caused by an increase in the expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on human platelets has been discussed as the underlying mechanism resulting in thrombotic occlusion of non-atherosclerotic coronary arteries. 5 Infusion of GPI may be beneficial in this setting but is often not sufficient as in the case presented. There is no clear recommendation for the optimal drug regimen after the acute intervention. We decided to prescribe dual antiplatelet therapy for discharge medication, which is recommended in the current guidelines after percutaneous coronary intervention in ACS. 2 In the ATLAS ACS 2\\u2013TIMI 51 trial, low-dose rivaroxaban has shown beneficial effects in patients with ACS. 6 A non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant was not administered in our patient. It may be speculated that low-dose rivaroxaban may have been particularly useful in the setting of repeated intracoronary thrombosis induced by cannabis use although there are yet no data to support this regimen in this specific clinical setting. This case additionally highlights the potential hazards of cannabis especially for patients maintaining consumption despite complications. A previously published case series illustrated the potential problem of cannabis-induced ACS in early adulthood. 4 Legalization of cannabis may lead to more widespread use of the drug which may potentially increase the incidence of ACS in young patients. 7 Conclusion This case report highlights the potential difficulties in the differential diagnosis of ACS in early adulthood. Prevalence of premature MI caused by cannabis consumption in early adulthood is low but may increase with cannabis legalization.

Introduction Bartonella henselae ( B. henselae ) is a Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the alpha2-subgroup of the class Proteobacteria. Two serotypes are known: Houston-1 serotype and Marseille serotype . Its major vector is the cat flea ( Ctenocephalides felis ) [ 2 , 3 ]. Transmission to humans occurs via contaminated cats' claws and teeth, which gives it the name cat scratch disease. Normally Bartonella rapidly migrates from the blood into endothelial cells. There it causes vasculoproliferative lesions: by activation of inflammatory and proinflammatory cascades, it stimulates angiogenesis and the formation of new capillaries from old ones, leading to bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis [ 4 , 5 ]. Bacillary peliosis is a rare condition caused by B. henselae infections of the parenchymal vasculature, which results in development of cystic, blood filled spaces in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, or lymph nodes, but furthermore it can also cause abscess-like formations . Bone involvement is a rare phenomenon in CSD. The infection probably spreads via the haematogenous route, accounting for disseminated cases, and via the lymphatic route, for cases with limited extension . It is most frequently reported in children and young adults and normally presents as fever with lymphadenopathy in the draining site of a cat scratch or bite . 2. Presentation In early November 2014 an 18-year-old man presented to our department with fever above 40\\u00b0C, headaches, night sweats, and diffuse arthralgia for the last two weeks. Suspecting a bacterial infection with an unknown focus, he had been treated with ampicillin/sulbactam in a secondary care hospital for two weeks. The patient reported having been on a one-week holiday in Turkey three months ago. At the time of admission he was doing his military service. Before military service he lived at his parents' farm, where several different animal species are kept, including cattle, chicken, and cats. The full medical examination showed no abnormalities except bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory investigations revealed markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 11.41\\u2009mg/dL on day of admission. White blood count was within the normal range with 9.21 G/L. Differential blood count showed a decrease in lymphocyte count of 16%. Antimicrobial therapy was stopped and serial blood cultures, serologies for Entamoeba , Francisella tularensis , Brucella spp., and fungal, bacterial, and viral broad-spectrum PCRs were performed. All results were negative and did not provide evidence for a specific infectious pathogen. Similarly, QuantiFeron-TB test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed negative results and screening for autoimmune antibodies including rheumatoid factor, c-ANCA, and p-ANCA did not indicate autoimmune disease. Due to the patient's symptoms, such as fever and lymphadenopathy, and his inconclusive laboratory findings, a CT scan was performed, which showed multiple hypodense hepatic and splenic lesions; the largest is 2\\u2009cm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore subchondral sclerosis and erosion of the ventral thoracic spine were shown with maximal affection of the seventh vertebral body. Given the ambiguous structure of the spine, a MRI was done, confirming a ventral base plate fracture of vertebral body 7 with reduction in height of 20% and bone marrow edema (Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ). The lesions were suggestive for an underlying infectious origin as were the hepatosplenic lesions. Due to the radiological appearance, the stagnant infection parameters with negative serologies for Francisella tularensis , Brucella spp., Entamoeba , and blood cultures for common infectious pathogens, and the patient's history of residency on a farm with cats, serologic testing for B. henselae was performed. IgM (1\\u2009:\\u20091000) and IgG (1\\u2009:\\u200910.000) antibodies for B. henselae were highly elevated. Consequently, according to recently published guidelines , the diagnosis of an atypical presentation of visceral cat scratch disease with bone involvement was established. Consequently, regarding a histopathological examination of a cervical lymph node, we decided not to take a biopsy, to avoid potential risks involved with this procedure, especially since diagnosis could be established with the patient's clinical presentation, history, laboratory findings, and serology. A PCR for Bartonella henselae could not be performed, as this test is not available in our hospital. 3. Treatment and Follow-Up Intravenous antimicrobial treatment with azithromycin (1.5\\u2009g total dose) and rifampicin 300\\u2009mg twice daily for 3 weeks was administered and resulted in a rapid decrease of inflammation markers (CRP of 11.4\\u2009mg/dL to 1.32\\u2009mg/dL within one week). Further follow-up serology for B. henselae remained positive with IgM antibodies 1\\u2009:\\u20091000 two weeks after discharge. CRP was decreasing to 0.81\\u2009mg/dL at this point. One month after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, abdominal MRI revealed markedly reduced hepatic lesions with a maximum of 1.2\\u2009cm in diameter (Figures 5 and 6 ). 4. Differential Diagnosis Diagnosis of CSD is often challenging, as the pathogen is very slowly growing and therefore hardly detectable in blood cultures. Histopathology usually shows a granulomatous infection with an acellular, necrotic center and B. henselae can be identified with Warthin-Starry silver stain. Nevertheless, even in histopathological examination the diagnosis of B. henselae is often challenging. Only recently, PCR for B. henselae has become available in clinical routine; however sensitivity is often low. Therefore B. henselae specific serology is still the main diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) are the main diagnostic features in detection of B. henselae . Both show high sensitivity (88%) and high specificity (97%) [ 6 , 9 \\u2013 16 ]. But still, there is significant cross-reaction with B. quintana and in patients with recent EBV infection (IgM positive for EBV), IgM for B. henselae might be wrongly positive. If a recent infection with B. henselae is suspected in a patient with IgM antibodies against EBV, physicians are advised to check on elevated IgG antibodies for B. henselae . If those are elevated as well, the patient is highly suspicious for being infected with CSD . Nevertheless Brucellosis and Tularemia should be considered as differential diagnosis for patients presenting with symptoms as described above. Although both pathogens are very rare in Central Europe, even among military personnel, there should be a serologic testing for Tularemia and Brucellosis . Both diseases are zoonotic infections with a broad range of symptoms and should definitely be excluded before diagnosis of CSD can be established; therefore at least serologies for theses pathogens should be performed if specific PCRs should not be available. 5. Discussion This case report shows a very rare presentation of CSD and how difficult and time-consuming diagnosis may be. Only 10% of patients with B. henselae infection develop hepatic granuloma or splenic abscess [ 8 , 19 ]. Similarly, bone involvement is a rare phenomenon and only 0.27% of patients reportedly develop osteomyelitis. Similar to our case, bone localization most often affected is the vertebral column (42%), followed by the pelvic girdle (27%) . As suggested by Margileth we agree that, to establish the diagnosis of CSD, three of four of the following criteria should be present : Cat or flea contact regardless of the presence of an inoculation site lesion. Negative serology for other causes of lymphadenopathy; sterile pus aspirated from a node; a positive Bartonella PCR assay; and/or liver or spleen lesions seen on CT scan. Positive serology for B. henselae with a titer ratio of \\u22651\\u2009:\\u200964. Biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation consistent with CSD or a positive Warthin-Starry silver stain. This report underlines the importance of considering CSD as differential diagnosis in young patients with fever of unknown origin and lymphadenopathy . Furthermore this case illustrates that CSD may present atypically and that B. henselae specific serology may provide the decisive information to reliable establish the diagnosis of CSD.\",\n          \"Introduction The most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves\\u2019 disease (GD) is thyroid eye disease (TED) 1 observed in 25\\u201350% of the Graves\\u2019 patients. A total of 75% of the patients with thyrotoxicosis develop Graves\\u2019 ophthalmopathy (GO) within a year of diagnosis. 2 TED is an autoimmune disorder that can cause a rise in retrobulbar pressure and proptosis due to inflammation, swelling, and fibrosis of the extraocular muscle (EOM). It is caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins targeting the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R), which can activate it and contribute to the development of TED. 3 In the majority of patients, both eyes are equally affected, although often in an asymmetric manner. 1 Unlike bilateral proptosis, which is mostly seen in thyroid disease, unilateral proptosis has a great variety of differential diagnoses, including orbital pseudotumor, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or intra-orbital neoplasms. 4 Unilateral ophthalmopathy mostly progresses to bilateral disease, while only 5\\u201311% of cases show no progression, making pure unilateral ophthalmopathy rare. 1 Here, we present the case of a young female with GD who developed unilateral proptosis without any visual disturbances. Case presentation A 25-year-old female presented to the outpatient department with a history of weight loss, menstrual irregularities, and occasional palpitations for 2 months. She had no history of night sweats, fever, chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath. She complained of bulging of her right eye, which was insidious in onset and gradually progressive without any difficulty in vision. There was no history of pain, discharge, redness, or trauma associated with her condition. She had no remarkable prior medical history nor any history of allergies to medication or other substances. She was a nonsmoker but consumed alcohol occasionally. At the time of her presentation to the hospital, she had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and a pulse rate of 125 beats/min. On ocular examination, her EOM movements were normal. The visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes, with a clinical severity score of 3/7, Hertel\\u2019s exophthalmometry of 23 mm in the right eye and 21 mm in the left eye. Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.6 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 7400/mm 3 with 57% neutrophils, 39% lymphocytes, and 3% monocytes. The free T3 level was 10.12 pmol/L (reference range: 3.10\\u20136.80), free T4 level was 25.88 pmol/L (reference range: 12.0\\u201322.0), TSH was 0.006 mIU/L (reference range: 0.27\\u20134.20), and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) was 3.56 IU/L (>1.75 (96% sensitivity and 99% specificity for GD)). The liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit revealed unilateral EOM enlargement and enhancement with tendon sparing and relative right proptosis ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. (a) Orbital axial and (b) orbital coronal; post-contrast MRI showing unilateral EOM enlargement and enhancement with tendon sparing and relative right proptosis. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; EOM: extraocular muscle. She was diagnosed with GD with GO and started on methimazole 5 mg twice daily with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg once weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 250 mg once weekly for 6 weeks for a total duration of 12 weeks. On follow-up after 3 months, she responded well to the medication, leading to the resolution of her eye symptoms. Discussion Our patient presents with proptosis, weight loss, menstrual irregularities, and palpitations, which are commonly seen in GD. However, our patients present with unilateral proptosis without any visual disturbances, and this is rare. GD is an autoimmune disorder that is more frequent between 20 and 50 years of age and occurs in 2% of women. 4 , 5 The annual incidence of GO is 16 per 100,000 women. 2 The symptoms of GO include a dry, gritty feeling in the eyes, photophobia, excessive tearing, double vision, and pressure feeling behind the eyes, as reported by nearly half of the patients of Graves\\u2019 hyperthyroidism. 6 The most typical symptoms of GO are proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, orbital congestion, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, conjunctival chemosis, difficulty moving eyes, eyelid retraction, and less frequently, compression of the optic nerve. 5 Proptosis can cause corneal exposure and injury in severe cases, especially if the lids fail to shut during sleep, and in most cases, there is subclinical involvement of the eyes. 6 The most widely accepted cause of Graves\\u2019 orbitopathy is the formation of autoantibodies against thyrotropin receptors located in both the thyroid gland and the orbit. This activates T cells, resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators. 7 Inflammatory cells and hyaluronans infiltrate the muscle, causing enlargement of the EOMs, an increase in the orbital fat volume, and ultimately, collagen deposition leading to fibrosis. 8 The disease often progresses via two distinct phases: an active, inflammatory phase followed by a static, non-inflammatory phase with fibrosis. 3 The risk factors for TED as smoking, older age, extreme physical or psychological stress, prior treatment with radioactive iodine, and increased titers of antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies are well described in published literature. 9 However, unilateral proptosis can be attributed to several factors, such as an asymmetrical distribution of antigens, anatomical variations in blood flow or lymphatic drainage, the elasticity of orbital septa, or other localized conditions. Infections or differences in the ability to generate adipose tissue can be a potential trigger for unilateral proptosis. 10 The onset of symptoms and unilateral proptosis involves a variety of alternate diagnoses including inflammatory, neoplastic, infectious, vascular, or neuromuscular conditions. 11 Orbital cellulitis is an acute condition that progresses rapidly. Orbital cellulitis mimics GO most frequently but may have a subacute onset over days or weeks, may be associated with pain, and involve any EOM, including the tendons, on MRI of the orbit. 11 The appearance of the extraocular eye muscles in MRI aids in differentiating TED from other conditions such as lymphoma and idiopathic orbital inflammation where the tendons are involved. 9 Neoplastic involvement was a consideration in our patient as it may present as a painless, restrictive eye involvement and occurs gradually over weeks or months, with or without a mass effect. 11 Lymphomas account for more than 50% of malignant orbital tumors in people 60 years and older, making them the most prevalent primary orbital tumors. 11 Computerized tomography (CT) of the orbit, MRI, and TRAb help diagnose GO. Orbital imaging is indicated in a patient with GO, particularly in a patient with unilateral proptosis. 5 In our patient, TRAb was positive with a rise in serum-free T3 and free T4 levels and a fall in TSH, suggesting GO and the high level of antithyroid peroxidase, which may indicate transient hyperthyroidism due to Hashitoxicosis. 12 The TRAb and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor antibodies could have contributed to the pathogenesis of infiltrative ophthalmopathy. 2 Corticosteroids are usually used in the treatment of GO due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. 13 Methimazole is an antithyroid medication for GD but does not directly affect extrathyroidal manifestations like GO. Our patient improved with combined therapy of corticosteroids and antithyroid medications. Reported cases of unilateral proptosis in GO are shown in Table 1 . Among the reported cases, four of them were euthyroid GD and two were hyperthyroid GD with subsequent eye symptoms. Our case reveals unilateral proptosis in hyperthyroid GD with no eye symptoms.

Conclusion This clinical case is a diagnostic challenge because the true unilateral disease is rare, and bilateral asymmetric eye involvement is seen in GO. Numerous differential diagnoses should be considered and studied before diagnosing this uncommon entity, even though noticeable unilateral proptosis supports the atypical presentation of GO in GD. The patient\\u2019s response to treatment medications suggests that timely therapy is crucial for reversing the ocular manifestation of TED.\",\n          \"1 INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID\\u201019) is an emerging infectious disease that manifests with varying symptoms such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. 1 Reports have shown that fever is the most common symptom, appearing in approximately 90% of the reported cases. However, the natural history and progression of fever due to COVID\\u201019 have not been fully understood. 2 Here, we present the case of a COVID\\u201019 patient exhibiting heatstroke\\u2010like symptoms. There are no published reports demonstrating an association between COVID\\u201019 and heatstroke or supporting proactive body temperature regulation; hence, this case report may contribute to understanding COVID\\u201019 pathology and its treatment. 2 CASE HISTORY A 47\\u2010year\\u2010old man presented with a 4\\u2010day history of fever and dyspnea. Two days before hospitalization, he tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, assessed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. He also had a 5\\u2010year history of untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus. On admission, his hemoglobin A1c level was 13%. He reported having no prior contact with other COVID\\u201019 patients. The patient presented to the hospital with a body temperature of 38.3\\u00b0C, heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 132/83\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 93% on ambient air. Chest computed tomography revealed ground\\u2010glass opacities and bilateral patchy shadows consistent with those of COVID\\u201019 pneumonia. On the second day of hospitalization, the patient's respiratory condition worsened; hence, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where oral intubation was initiated to provide artificial respiration. The patient had remittent fever, with a temperature ranging from 37.5\\u00b0C to 40.4\\u00b0C, on hospitalization days 6\\u20108. On day 9, he developed sustained fever, with a temperature of 40\\u00b0C to 41\\u00b0C (Figure 1 ), for which acetaminophen was ineffective. This was accompanied by a marked disturbance in consciousness. His systolic blood pressure dropped below 70\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg, leading to warm shock. Respiratory condition further deteriorated on the night of day 9, with the partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio decreasing from 202\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg to 140\\u00a0mm\\u00a0Hg. Large\\u2010volume infusion of fluids was started along with the administration of vasopressors (noradrenaline, vasopressin, and adrenaline) and hydrocortisone. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA\\u2010ECMO) was initiated on the night of day 9 itself owing to worsening hemodynamics. Laboratory results (Table 1 ) revealed lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic dysfunction, and significant rhabdomyolysis. After the initiation of VA\\u2010ECMO, the patient's sustained fever was rapidly alleviated, and the symptoms of multiorgan failure also began to improve gradually. VA\\u2010ECMO support was withdrawn on day 22. Life\\u2010prolonging treatment was withheld because of repeated severe cerebral infarction and hemorrhage that led to central nervous system damage. The patient died on day 30. Although favipiravir was administered to treat the patient's infection from the day 1 of his admission to the ICU, it was discontinued on day 7 because of the possibility of drug\\u2010induced rhabdomyolysis. Broad\\u2010spectrum antibiotics were administered from the day he was admitted to the ICU to prevent secondary bacterial infections.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 3 DISCUSSION We describe the case of a 47\\u2010year\\u2010old man positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented with a 4\\u2010day history of fever and dyspnea. His chest computed tomography findings were consistent with those of COVID\\u201019 pneumonia; laboratory test results and clinical findings revealed multiorgan failure and extremely elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. The proportion of CK\\u2010MB was not high; thus, we did not suggest heart diseases. However, several other differential diagnoses, such as malignant hyperthermia, malignant syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis, were thought of causing severe CK elevation. As the patient was not taking any volatile anesthetic (eg, halothane,\\u00a0isoflurane,\\u00a0sevoflurane,\\u00a0desflurane),\\u00a0succinylcholine, or antipsychotic drugs, malignant hyperthermia and malignant syndrome were ruled out. However, the CK elevation was later thought to be a symptom of rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, his initially remittent fever later developed into the sustained type, a sequela that has not yet been associated with previous COVID\\u201019 cases. Furthermore, altered consciousness, multiorgan failure, and extreme hyperthermia with a temperature >40.5\\u00b0C are symptoms consistent with heatstroke. 3 In addition, the patient had a 5\\u2010year history of untreated diabetes mellitus that could have had a role in the disease course and outcome of the patient, which should be investigated in subsequent similar reports. In addition to these findings, the symptoms of multiorgan failure began to show signs of improvement upon regulation of the body temperature using VA\\u2010ECMO. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may have been caused by heat stress. In the case of heatstroke, oxidative phosphorylation becomes uncoupled because of extreme hyperthermia and a variety of enzymes cease to function. A cytokine\\u2010mediated systemic inflammatory response develops, and the production of heat\\u2010shock proteins is increased. Blood is shunted from the splanchnic circulation to the skin and muscles, resulting in gastrointestinal ischemia and an increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa. Hepatocytes, vascular endothelium, and neural tissue are most sensitive to increased core temperatures, but all organs may ultimately be involved. Typical symptoms of heatstroke are a rectal core temperature of 105\\u00b0F (40.6\\u00b0C) or greater, multiorgan damage, and central nervous dysfunction, 4 and in severe cases, circulation failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation are found. 5 His clinical symptoms are consistent with heatstroke, but the absence of environmental factors that could have caused this condition makes proving an association between this case and heatstroke difficult. We thought that the heat dissipation mechanism could be disrupted by COVID\\u201019, which caused prolonged hyperthermia and acute physiological alterations such as circulatory failure, hypoxemia, and increased metabolic demands, and direct heat\\u2010related cytotoxic effects could escalate, causing multiorgan failure. Despite all this, it must be noted that fever has beneficial effects, such as strengthening the immune response. 6 Proactive core body temperature regulation such as using extracorporeal apparatus is usually not conducted for hyperthermia but should be considered in cases of COVID\\u201019. 4 CONCLUSION While there are no clear indications for body temperature control during viral infections such as COVID\\u201019, if heat stress caused by COVID\\u201019 leads to organ failure, then proactive body temperature regulation may be an effective treatment option. This report may help in understanding COVID\\u201019 pathology and treatment better owing to the possible demonstration of an association between COVID\\u201019 and heatstroke.

History of breast cancer treated with radiotherapy 3 years ago<br>3. 1-month history of severe headache refractory to medication<br>4. CT: Multiple hypodense lesions in cerebral parenchyma<br>5. MRI: Multiple rounded cystic lesions, hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2<br>6. Each lesion contains an internal nodular structure resembling a scolex<br>7. Peripheral contrast enhancement most pronounced around mural nodules<br>8. No improvement with 5-day course of albendazole<br><br>The imaging description is very characteristic - cystic lesions with internal nodular structures resembling a scolex, with peripheral enhancement around the mural nodules. This is classic for neurocysticercosis.<br><br>However, I need to consider the lack of response to albendazole. Neurocysticercosis typically responds to antiparasitic therapy like albendazole or praziquantel.<br><br>The history of breast cancer and radiotherapy is also important - this raises the possibility of brain metastases.<br><br>Let me consider the differentials:<br><br>1. Neurocysticercosis - The imaging is very characteristic (cystic lesions with scolex-like internal nodules), but the lack of response to albendazole is concerning.<br><br>2. Brain metastases from breast cancer - Given the history, this is certainly possible. However, metastases don't typically have the characteristic scolex-like appearance.<br><br>3. Other parasitic infections - Could consider other cystic parasites, but the scolex-like appearance is very specific for cysticercosis.<br><br>4. Cystic gliomas or other primary brain tumors - Less likely given the multiple nature and characteristic appearance.<br><br>The key here is the very specific imaging description - \"internal nodular structure resembling a scolex\" is virtually pathognomonic for neurocysticercosis. <br><br>I'm investigating potential reasons for the treatment's ineffectiveness. Multiple factors could explain the poor response: insufficient treatment duration, varied cyst stages, potential drug resistance, or a possible misdiagnosis. Despite these complications, the distinctive imaging findings strongly support neurocysticercosis as the primary diagnosis. The complex clinical picture requires a nuanced approach, carefully weighing the characteristic radiological evidence against the unexpected treatment outcome.\n",

              "            1. Neurocysticercosis considered because of the appearance of a mural nodule resembling a scolex on MRI — “MRI showed cystic lesions with an internal nodular structure that was similar to a scolex, thus suggesting the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.”  <br>2. Neurocysticercosis excluded due to the presence of contrast enhancement around all lesions, a feature uncommon in parasitic cysts but typical of metastases — “One clue in this case could be the contrast enhancement around all the lesions, which is not seen in neurocysticercosis but occurs in brain metastases.”  <br>3. Primary brain tumors contemplated but deemed unlikely given the multiplicity of lesions — “Primary brain tumors are rarely multiple.”  <br>4. Metastatic carcinoma from breast supported by immunohistochemical profile showing cytokeratin 7 positivity and cytokeratin 20 negativity — “Cytokeratin 7 positivity and cytokeratin 20 negativity promote the breast as the primary site.”  <br>5. Lung or thyroid primary excluded by lack of TTF-1 expression — “Negativity for the TTF-1 marker rules out the possibility of thyroid and primary neuroendocrine lung tumor as the primary site.”\n",

His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, blood pressure was 124/66 mmHg and heart rate was 86 beats/min. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade 4/6 continuous biphasic murmur along the left sternal border and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex. There were no stigmata of Marfan syndrome.\\n\\nElectrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ST\\u2013T\\u2013wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated:\\n- A dilated heart with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 42%.  \\n- An abnormal channel between the ascending aorta and left ventricle, visualized in the parasternal long-axis view.  \\n- Color Doppler imaging revealed anterograde systolic and retrograde diastolic flow between the aorta and left ventricle, with retrograde diastolic flow also seen in the apical five-chamber view.  \\n- On a modified parasternal long-axis view, a third orifice communicating with the right ventricle was identified; color Doppler showed a jet from the channel into the right ventricle, and a biphasic spectral profile (peak velocity 489 cm/s) was recorded.  \\n- The aortic valve was tricuspid, calcified, and had a small aneurysm of the noncoronary cusp.  \\n- The posterior mitral leaflet at P2\\u2013P3 segments showed chordal rupture with severe eccentric regurgitation.\\n\\nLaboratory studies revealed an N-terminal pro\\u2013brain natriuretic peptide level of 641 pg/mL; other blood counts, electrolytes, renal and hepatic panels, coagulation tests, autoimmune and inflammatory markers were within normal limits.\",\n          \"A 59-year-old man presented in December with progressive headache, slowed speech, gait disturbance, and weakness. His temperature was 37.2 \\u00b0C, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 84 bpm, and respiration 24 breaths/min. Neurological and fundoscopic examinations were normal. \\nCranial MRI showed bilateral cerebral and cerebellar millimetric gliotic lesions and leptomeningeal enhancement. \\nLumbar puncture revealed clear fluid with an opening pressure of 19 cmH\\u2082O, 302 leukocytes/\\u00b5L (5% polymorphonuclear, 95% lymphomononuclear), protein 113 mg/dL, glucose 30 mg/dL (blood glucose 147 mg/dL). CSF studies for lymphoma, a paraneoplastic panel, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and India ink for Cryptococcus neoformans were all negative. Diffusion\\u2010weighted imaging demonstrated acute ischemic lesions in the right caudate nucleus and left internal capsule; aspirin was started. His headache persisted despite slight overall improvement.\\nApproximately eight months later, he re-presented with worsened speech, somnolence, and weakness. Neurological examination now revealed dysarthria and inability to walk. Cardiac evaluation and large\\u2010vessel imaging were normal; cerebral angiography showed hypoplastic left A1 and right P1 segments. A presumptive diagnosis of CNS vasculitis was made, and he received a 7-day steroid pulse plus one dose of cyclophosphamide. \\nThe following day he developed fever (38.1 \\u00b0C) without meningeal signs. Repeat lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 23 cmH\\u2082O, 193 leukocytes/\\u00b5L (67% polymorphonuclear, 32% lymphomononuclear), protein 313 mg/dL, and glucose 11 mg/dL (blood glucose 101 mg/dL); therapeutic CSF drainage was performed.\",\n          \"A 44-year-old woman presented with 2 weeks of painless jaundice, anorexia, pale stools, and dark urine.

She denied alcohol use, acetaminophen use, and risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination showed scleral icterus without abdominal tenderness or stigmata of chronic liver disease.\\n\\nLaboratory studies on admission:\\n- AST 1092 U/L, ALT 1185 U/L  \\n- Total bilirubin 9.0 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL  \\n- INR 1.8  \\n- Alkaline phosphatase 118 U/L (normal)\\n\\nRight upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a 1.6 cm shadowing calculus in the gallbladder neck and 0.9 cm gallbladder wall thickening; intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts were not dilated. A HIDA scan demonstrated hepatic dysfunction.

A noncontrast CT scan demonstrated an intra-articular fracture extending to both intercondylar spines and a 29 × 27 × 26 mm focal lytic lesion with non-sclerotic “map-like” margins, cortical thinning posteriorly, no periosteal reaction or trabecular edema, and a solid matrix (50–90 HU) without calcifications; severe osteoporosis, diffuse popliteal vascular calcifications, and joint effusion were also noted. Bedside ultrasound revealed diffuse periarticular microcrystalline deposits on the patellar cartilage and menisci without active synovitis. To exclude malignancy, a contrast-enhanced total-body CT showed no macroscopic tumor lesions, and tumor markers with serum free chains and Bence-Jones protein assays were negative. A CT-guided biopsy was scheduled to determine the nature of the lesion.',\n",

He had intermittent episodes over several years that were resistant to verapamil, flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol; adenosine did not terminate the tachycardia. A 12-lead ECG showed a rate of 200 beats/min, atrioventricular dissociation, and onset after two normally conducted sinus beats, with subtle QRS changes (lower R-wave in V1, loss of Q waves in V5–V6, slight leftward axis shift) consistent with right-to-left septal activation.\\n\\nAn electrophysiological study used multipolar catheters in the coronary sinus, His-bundle region, right ventricular septum, and apex. In sinus rhythm, AH and HV intervals were 65 ms and 55 ms, respectively; during tachycardia (cycle length, 310 ms), the HV interval was 50 ms, and His electrograms preceded each QRS. His activation was proximal-to-distal in sinus rhythm but simultaneous on proximal and distal electrodes during tachycardia. Atrial activation was dissociated. Tachycardia could not be initiated by atrial stimulation but was incessant and was repeatedly terminated by premature ventricular beats (PVBs) or overdrive ventricular pacing.\\n\\nTo differentiate narrow-QRS tachycardias with ventriculoatrial dissociation, single PVBs were delivered from the right ventricular apex and septum during tachycardia. Late-coupled PVBs introduced when the His bundle was refractory advanced the next His electrogram and reset the tachycardia. Progressive shortening of the PVB coupling interval produced reset with progressive fusion on surface ECG, demonstrating ventricular involvement in the circuit. Overdrive pacing from the right ventricular apex entrained the tachycardia with progressive fusion and postpacing intervals < tachycardia cycle length + 115 ms. Programmed stimulation from the anterosuperior right ventricular septum showed that premature beats from the para-Hisian area captured the His bundle and reset the tachycardia with a QRS similar to sinus rhythm, whereas very late coupled PVBs delivered distally after right bundle branch activation reset the tachycardia with concealed fusion on the surface ECG.',\n",

              "            A 64-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of swelling in the left clavicular region that had progressively increased in size and become painful. She reported long-term polyarthralgia and myalgia but had no motor or sensory deficits in the left upper limb. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed increased opacification in the left medial clavicular area, and a focused clavicle radiograph demonstrated concentric thickening of the medial and middle thirds of the left clavicle without cortical disruption. Non-contrast CT revealed a 49 × 28 × 21 mm soft-tissue lesion under the left pectoral muscles—between the first rib, its chondrocostal joint, and the clavicle—containing chondroid calcifications, associated with new bone formation and erosions of the inferior clavicular margin. MRI confirmed a heterogeneous soft-tissue mass adjacent to the distal clavicle, isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images with a hypointense peripheral rim corresponding to calcifications, significant contrast enhancement, and a poor cleavage plane with the subclavian neurovascular bundle. Because of these findings, the initial diagnostic consideration was synovial osteochondromatosis, although it was not possible to completely rule out a primary cartilaginous tumor of the soft tissue, such as chondroma, periosteal chondroma, or chondrosarcoma.\n",

Synovial osteochondromatosis was initially favored because of the lesion’s location near a joint and chondroid calcifications — “initial diagnostic consideration was synovial osteochondromatosis…”<br>2. Chondroma and periosteal chondroma were considered as primary cartilaginous tumors but could not be definitively diagnosed on imaging alone — “…it was not possible to completely rule out a primary cartilaginous tumor of the soft tissue, such as chondroma, periosteal chondroma, or chondrosarcoma.”<br>3. Chondrosarcoma was considered given bone erosion and calcified cartilage but was excluded by biopsy findings showing benign features — “No significant atypia was observed … There was no necrosis or hypercellularity and the lesion did not appear to infiltrate adjacent tissues.”<br>4. Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma was confirmed by the distinctive histologic pattern of central calcification within chondroid metaplasia surrounded by denser connective tissue — “the special distribution of calcification in the center of the chondroid metaplasia surrounded by a denser connective tissue was highly reminiscent of a CAF.”\n",

It is characterized by sclerotic, tumefactive lesions with marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells. First recognized as a distinct disease in 2003 among patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, 1 the characteristic lesions of this systemic disease have been described in almost every major organ system of the body. Orbital and adnexal involvement in IgG4-related disease is common; more specifically, it is referred to as IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD). IgG4-ROD manifests with varying clinical presentations, symptoms and disease severity. The lacrimal gland is the most frequently involved ocular structure in IgG4-ROD, though lymphoplasmacytic infiltration can occur in almost any tissue of the orbit and adnexa including the trigeminal nerve, extraocular muscles, orbital fat, eyelid, and, less frequently, the nasolacrimal duct. 2 , 3 Diagnosis of the disease requires correlation between the clinical features, imaging studies, and histopathology results. Given the relatively recent recognition of IgG4-related disease as its own clinical entity, the scientific community's awareness of the condition, understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management options for IgG4-related disease continues to evolve. This case of profound bilateral orbital inflammation is presented to further demonstrate the many clinical manifestations of IgG4-ROD and to maintain a heightened awareness of the disease among providers. 2 Case report A 52-year-old man presented in the Oculoplastics clinic in May 2022 with a chief complaint of \\u201cbulging eyes.\\u201d He reported significant swelling of both eyelids over the past year, which had progressively worsened despite several courses of oral steroids. Past medical history was significant for type II diabetes mellitus, and a recent hemoglobin A1C of 5.9. He endorsed chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as a history of enlarged lymph nodes. In 2014, the patient underwent fine needle aspiration of an enlarged left submandibular gland; the findings were most consistent with a reactive lymph node without cytological evidence for lymphoma or malignancy. The patient reported good health without other known medical conditions. Initial clinical exam was notable for proptosis and 4+ bilateral upper and lower lid swelling and induration. Focal masses of the left eyelids were notably larger compared to the right eyelids. The extensive lid fullness resulted in mechanical ptosis, with an MRD1 of 0 in each eye ( Fig. 1 ). The patient demonstrated a nontender, enlarged left submandibular lymph node. His pupillary response and extraocular movements were unremarkable. Fig. 1 Peri-operative external photographs. A) Pre-operative diffuse bilateral periorbital swelling with mechanical ptosis. B) Bilateral lid fullness and proptosis following diagnostic left orbital biopsy. Fig. 1 Laboratory evaluation was notable for elevation in serum immunoglobulin G (2149; reference range 603\\u20131613 mg/dL) as well as total immunoglobulin E (1026; reference range 6\\u2013495). Further evaluation of IgG subclasses revealed significantly elevated serum IgG4 (621; reference range 2\\u201396 mg/dL). Of note, results were not consistent with thyroid disease, ANCA-vasculitides, sarcoidosis, necrotizing myopathy, nor infection. The patient's complete blood count and complement factors were within normal limits. MRI brain/orbits with contrast was obtained. Imaging demonstrated severe proptosis of the bilateral globes with associated straightening of the optic nerves. There was diffuse enlargement of the lacrimal glands as well as the extraocular muscles bilaterally. Inflammatory changes were seen in the eyelid and retrobulbar fat bilaterally, with associated stranding within the bilateral orbital fat and crowding of the orbital apex. Additionally, imaging showed diffuse sinus inflammatory disease, most severe within the bilateral ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses ( Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. A) T1-weighted coronal scan demonstrates inflammatory changes and expansion of the adnexal fat bilaterally. B) T1-weighted axial scan shows enlargement of the bilateral lacrimal glands and extraocular muscles as well severe proptosis of bilateral globes with associated straightening of the optic nerves. C) T2-weighted coronal scan through the mid orbits displays inflammatory changes of the retrobulbar fat. Fig. 2 The patient underwent a diagnostic left anterior orbitotomy with biopsy of the left orbital fat and left orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland for histopathologic assessment ( Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Intra-operative photographs. A) Enlargement of the orbital lobe of the left lacrimal gland before biopsy. B) Fibrotic changes and abnormal appearance of the left orbital fat. Fig. 3 Flow cytometry of the specimens did not demonstrate a monoclonal B-cell population or immunophenotypically abnormal T-cell population. Histopathology of the orbital fat and lacrimal gland biopsies did demonstrate a prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, including follicle formation, in the background of fibrosis. Immunohistochemical stains for IgG4 highlighted a significant subset of plasma cells, >400\\u00a0cells per single high-power field on both samples. IgG4: IgG ratio estimated 50\\u201360% on both. No well-formed granulomas were identified. Neither specimen demonstrated obliterative thrombophlebitis. Overall, the pathology revealed a pattern of chronic inflammation and fibrosis histologically highly suggestive of IgG4-related disease using consensus criteria 4 and were consistent with definite IgG4-related disease using comprehensive and organ specific criteria 5 ( Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Biopsies of the orbit and lacrimal gland showing chronic inflammation and fibrosis histologically suggestive of IgG4-related disease. A) Prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, including follicle formation, in the background of fibrosis (hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification \\u00d720); B) Large subset of IgG-positive plasma cells (IgG immunohistochemical stain, magnification \\u00d720); C) Significant subset of IgG4-positive plasma cells, >400\\u00a0cells per high-power field, seen in each biopsy [IgG4 immunohistochemical stain, magnification \\u00d720 (left) and magnification \\u00d710 (right)]. Fig. 4 Re-examination of the fine needle aspiration of the left submandibular node biopsy from 2014 was inconclusive. This may be related to extent of disease at the time, or insufficient tissue to draw a conclusion. Together, the clinical findings, imaging, and histopathology were compatible with IgG4-ROD. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist for further work-up and assistance with systemic management. Initiation of oral corticosteroid induction therapy resulted in a dramatic improvement in his clinical appearance ( Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5 Clinical photograph demonstrating significant improvement in periorbital edema following corticosteroid induction therapy. Fig. 5 3 Discussion IgG-RD is now recognized as a distinct entity with a multitude of clinical manifestations depending on the organ system or systems affected. The orbit is a frequent site of involvement; however, IgG-ROD alone can present in a variety of ways. Prior reports have recognized the following patterns as the most common manifestations of IgG-ROD. \\u2022 Sclerosing dacryoadenitis: the lacrimal gland is the most common site involved in IgG-ROD. This frequently presents as unilateral or bilateral eyelid swelling and may be associated with salivary gland swelling. This pattern, previously known as \\u201cMikulicz's disease,\\u201d was described in the literature long before the recognition of IgG-RD as a unique clinical entity. Patients may experience dry eye symptoms from lacrimal gland dysfunction. \\u2022 Enlargement of the trigeminal nerve: enlargement of multiple branches of the trigeminal nerve (particularly the infraorbital nerve) is frequently associated with enlargement of the lacrimal glands and extraocular muscles. Peripheral eosinophilia and paranasal sinusitis are often present as well. \\u2022 Orbital fat infiltration: Patients may present with proptosis in the setting of orbital fat enlargement. Orbital fat infiltration is usually associated with lacrimal gland enlargement and can be associated extraocular muscle changes resulting in motility issues. Less commonly, IgG4-ROD may involve the lacrimal drainage system, sclera, and conjunctiva. In rare, severe cases, vision loss can occur due to optic nerve compression at the orbital apex. 3 Given the diversity of disease manifestations and the clinically ambiguous signs and symptoms of IgG-ROD, providers must maintain a high level of suspicion of the disease and actively pursue targeted diagnostic measures to arrive at the accurate diagnosis. Diagnosis of IgG4-ROD requires integration of clinical signs, laboratory results, orbital imaging, and histopathologic findings. In order to make a definitive diagnosis, biopsy for histopathologic examination is essential. Compared to needle biopsy, surgical biopsy is superior in histologically identifying IgG4-RD. 4 , 5 This may have contributed to the inability to diagnose this patient from the submandibular node fine needle biopsy years earlier. Multiple criteria for diagnosis of systemic IgG4-RD have been proposed. 4 , 6 , 7 , Of these, the most recent IgG4-RD classification criteria, proposed and validated in 2019, incorporates a series of both exclusion and weighted inclusion criteria to identify IgG4-RD with excellent sensitivity and specificity. 7 Organ specific criteria have additionally been published. For orbital disease specifically, Goto et al. developed the following diagnostic criteria for IgG4-ROD in 2015. 1. Imaging studies show enlargement of the lacrimal gland, trigeminal nerve, or extraocular muscle as well as masses, enlargement, or hypertrophic lesions in various ophthalmic tissues. 2. Histopathologic examination shows marked lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration, and sometimes fibrosis. A germinal center is frequently observed. IgG4+ plasmacytes are found and satisfy the following criteria: Ratio of IgG4+ cells to IgG\\u00a0+\\u00a0cells of >40%, or >50 IgG4+ cells per high-power field (x400). 3. Blood test shows elevated serum IgG4 (>135 mg/dl) Diagnosis is classified as \\u201cdefinitive\\u201d when (1), (2), and (3) are satisfied; \\u201cprobable\\u201d when (1) and (2) are satisfied; and \\u201cpossible\\u201d when (1) and (3) are satisfied. 8 In order to diagnose IgG4-ROD, alternative diagnoses must be ruled out. The differential diagnosis of IgG4-ROD includes: Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, ANCA-associated vasculitides, thyroid-related orbitopathy, infection, and idiopathic orbital inflammation. In multiple studies, retrospective review of histopathology slides showed that a significant portion of cases initially diagnosed as idiopathic orbital inflammation or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia were in fact IgG4-ROD. 9 , 10 Many alternative diseases also contain a high number of IgG4+ cells; therefore, the ratio of IgG4 to IgG may be of greater importance. Of note, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma can also contain IgG4+ cells. Differentiating between these two prevalent lymphoproliferative diseases of the orbit is critical. 8 Despite its inclusion in the majority of proposed diagnostic criteria of both IgG4-RD and IgG4-ROD, elevation of serum IgG4 is neither necessary nor specific to the disease. On average, patients with IgG4-RD have a significantly higher serum IgG4 level compared to those without the disease. However, the range in levels is broad, and research supports that patients with biopsy-proven IgG4-RD can have normal levels of serum IgG4. 11 , 12 Therefore, the diagnostic criteria proposed by Goto et al., which requires elevation in serum IgG4 levels to meet criteria for \\u201cdefinitive\\u201d IgG4-ROD, may be misleading at this time. When used in isolation, elevated serum IgG4 is of limited diagnostic utility; however, serum IgG4 levels may be helpful during disease work-up and while monitoring the response to treatment. 13 Similarly, serum IgE concentrations on average are elevated in patients diagnosed with IgG4-RD. The significance of this laboratory abnormality in the diagnosis and management of IgG4-RD remains an active area of research. 15 , 16 , 17 Among patients with IgG4-RD, elevation in serum IgE concentration at baseline is associated with increased risk of IgG4-RD relapse; therefore, IgE levels at the time of diagnosis can serve as a predictor for the disease trajectory. 15 , 17 , 18 The majority of patients with IgG4-ROD will have systemic disease with additional organs affected by IgG4-RD. 3 , 19 Common organ systems involved in IgG4-RD include the pancreas/biliary tree, salivary glands, lymph nodes, retroperitoneum, aorta, kidney, and lungs. 14 Given the high probability of systemic disease, referral to a rheumatologist to further investigate involvement of other organs is essential. Oral corticosteroids remain the mainstay of initial treatment for active disease, with an induction course followed by a slow taper. 19 Patients may require maintenance dosing to prevent disease relapse. Consistent with prior reports, this case demonstrates that an excellent response to steroid induction therapy is possible even in long-standing disease. 20 , 21 However, while the majority of IgG4-ROD cases show a therapeutic response to induction therapy, relapse rates remain high and disease remission off medication is rare. 19 , 22 In cases of recalcitrant or recurrent disease, various steroid-sparing immunosuppressants have been utilized, of which Rituximab has shown the most promising therapeutic effects. 19 Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, reduces the circulating IgG4-producing memory B cells and related CD20-positive precursors, thereby decreasing the level of plasmablasts and serum IgG4. 23 Rituximab maintenance therapy has also shown to reduce circulating biomarkers of fibrosis and tissue myofibroblast activation. 24 Other emerging biologics, such as FcRn inhibitors, additionally demonstrate promising therapeutic potential. The neonatal fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptor (FcRn) is involved in the recycling pathway of IgG, functioning to return intact IgG back into the circulation by preventing lysosomal degradation. 23 FcRn inhibition, therefore, selectively leads to increased catabolism of each IgG subclasses. While ongoing trials suggest promising potential, further studies are needed to better understand the role of biologics, both established and emerging, in the treatment paradigm for IgG4-ROD. 23 , 25 4 Conclusions IgG4-ROD is a fibroinflammatory condition that clinically presents in a myriad of ways. Elevated serum IgG4 is not a unique biomarker for the disease, and mimickers of IgG4-ROD must be ruled out. Ultimately, surgical biopsy for histopathology is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis. Needle biopsy can yield insufficient tissue to histologically recognize IgG4-RD, which may lead to a delay in diagnosis. Ophthalmologists must maintain a high level of suspicion for IgG4-ROD when a patient presents with an inflammatory orbital process of unclear etiology. IgG4-ROD may be one manifestation of a systemic condition. Timely diagnosis and prompt referral for thorough work-up and targeted management is a critical part of providing comprehensive care for the patient. Though corticosteroids are the current mainstay of treatment, biologics such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and FcRn inhibitors may prove effective therapeutic alternatives.

Although chronic-sclerosing sialadenitis has a clear predilection for the submandibular glands, it may involve the parotid glands, thus mimicking other causes of salivary gland enlargement such as Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome and Mikulicz disease. Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting salivary and lacrimal glands. Mikulicz disease\\u2014a term that has fallen from contemporary use\\u2014was initially described in the 19th century to characterize idiopathic chronic enlargement of the submandibular, parotid, and lacrimal glands. Immunohistochemical technology to identify immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 molecules on plasma cells has permitted reclassification of a subgroup of salivary gland swelling cases previously considered idiopathic. IgG4 is a subclass of IgG usually found at low serum concentrations and, unlike other subclasses, is elevated in association with allergic reactions and autoimmune diseases rather than microbial infection\\n\\n. High IgG4 titers can be found in various fibroinflammatory conditions such as bronchiectasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, vasculitis, and the newly classified spectrum of diseases entitled IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD). Despite this association with various pathological processes, increased IgG4 levels are not thought to initiate inflammation or fibrosis but rather are believed to modulate chronic inflammation. Although knowledge regarding IgG4RD has increased over the last decade, diagnostic challenges remain. The variability of clinical presentation due to the wide range of potentially affected organs in IgG4RD makes the diagnosis difficult\\u2014sometimes taking years to establish\\n\\n. This report is intended to increase awareness of IgG4RD as a process that may present as isolated submandibular gland swelling in a child. Case report A 16-year-old Hispanic male was referred to a regional hospital after bilateral neck masses were noted during a routine examination. The masses were first noted by the patient 2 months before his initial visit with slowly progressive enlargement thereafter. He denied fever, sweating, weight loss, and local phlogistic signs. Initial physical examination was unremarkable other than firm bilateral submandibular masses. Due to concern for possible bacterial infection, a course of antibiotics was prescribed but without improvement in submandibular gland swelling. Evaluations by otolaryngology and rheumatology confirmed the isolated submandibular gland enlargement. The neck was symmetric with enlargement of firm submandibular glands approximately 4 cm in diameter ( Fig.\\u00a01 ). Initial diagnostic considerations included tuberculosis, Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome, and lymphoma. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated homogenous enlargement of the bilateral submandibular glands without ductal dilation or ductal stones. Parotid and lacrimal glands were normal in appearance. No lymphadenopathy or thyroid abnormalities were appreciated ( Fig.\\u00a02 ). The initial pathologic analysis of open surgical biopsy of the left submandibular gland revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate composed of a mixture of B and T lymphocytes as shown by immunohistochemical staining with evidence of reactive secondary lymphoid follicle formation, consistent with a reactive inflammatory process without evidence of lymphoid neoplasia ( Fig. 3 A and B ). Abnormal laboratory results revealed low C3 (87 mg/dL; normal lower limit, 90 mg/dL) and elevated total IgG of 1885 mg/dL (normal upper limit, 1584 mg/dL). These findings may occur in inflammatory states such as with several autoimmune rheumatologic diseases. Low complements (such as C3) in children may reflect genetic deficiency, which can predispose to rheumatic disease, though in such cases, the levels of C3 are much lower than just below normal as noted here. Other blood tests were normal including Quantiferon gold TB test, urinalysis, renal and liver function, blood cell counts, hepatitis B and C tests, and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate max of 10 mm/h, C reactive protein <.5 mg/dL). Autoantibodies (including SS-A, SS-B, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor) which may be positive in Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome or other rheumatologic diseases were all negative. Together, these findings suggested against lymphoma or tuberculosis as the underlying etiology. Although the histopathology was consistent with possible Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome and a minority of children with Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome may be negative for autoantibodies, the CT findings of normal parotid glands was highly atypical for childhood Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome. Because IgG4RD may present with isolated salivary gland swelling, further diagnostic evaluation specifically for IgG4RD was recommended. Immunostaining of the biopsy specimen revealed 365 IgG+ cells per high power field (hpf) and 266 IgG4+ cells/hpf, resulting in an IgG4+/IgG ratio of 72.8% ( Fig. 3 C). Quantitative serum IgG subclass analysis revealed markedly elevated IgG4 at 1050 mg/dL (normal upper limit 89\\u00a0mg/dL) and elevated IgG2 at 874 mg/dL (normal upper limit 549 mg/dL), with IgG1 and IgG3 within reference range. These\\u00a0findings of markedly elevated IgG4+/IgG+ cell ratio within the gland as well as markedly elevated serum IgG4 confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4RD manifested by chronic sialadenitis. After diagnosis, oral prednisone therapy was started at 40 mg per day for 2 weeks with a subsequent tapering dose over the next 4 weeks. Submandibular gland swelling improved markedly with only subtle persistent swelling present at follow-up 1 year after discontinuation of prednisone. Throughout the course and at follow-up, no submandibular gland tenderness was noted, and no other organ manifestations developed. Discussion IgG4RD has gained attention due to identification of fibrosis in multiple organ sites associated with intense tissue infiltration by IgG4+ cells. Common involvement with IgG4+ infiltration has linked CCS along with other inflammatory conditions such as type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis and Reidel thyroiditis, which are all now considered part of the IgG4RD spectrum.\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis for IgG4-related sialadenitis includes infection (such as tuberculosis), lymphoma, Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome, sarcoidosis, and sialodocholithiasis.\\n\\nThe pathogenesis of IgG4RD remains uncertain but is thought to be linked to upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and extracellular matrix formation.\\n\\nIgG4RD has become better recognized in adults (mean age, 53 years) in whom it mostly presents with symptoms involving the salivary and lacrimal glands, pancreas, and lymph nodes.\\n\\n,\\n\\nChildren and adolescents have not been included in larger IgG4RD studies and have been discussed mainly by case reports. In the pediatric population, pancreatic involvement was less common, whereas head and neck involvement continues to predominant, albeit with different organ distribution than adults. Most pediatric patients had orbital involvement, followed by sinonasal disease, lacrimal gland disease, and sialadenitis.\\n\\nOther manifestations included disease of the mediastinum, retroperitoneum\\n\\n, pancreas, lung, and mesenterium. Histologic IgG4RD is suggested when at least one of the following is seen: dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform-type fibrosis, or obliterative phlebitis. Tissue immunostaining should reveal at least 10 IgG4+/hpf, but for lacrimal and salivary glands, a more expressive count of IgG4+ plasma cell per hpf is recommended (>100 IgG4+/hpf). In addition, tissue IgG4+/IgG+ ratio must be >40% in any circumstance.\\n\\nSerum IgG4 is frequently elevated but can be normal in up to 50% of patients with active IgG4RD.\\n\\nIn our case, dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was observed, with 266 IgG4+/hpf count, but other characteristic histologic features were absent. The combination of the patient\\u2019s clinical findings, serum IgG4 titer, tissue IgG4+/IgG ratio, and imaging studies demonstrates a pattern consistent with IgG4RD.\\n\\nRadiological studies often reveal nonspecific findings such as diffuse organ enlargement, homogeneous contrast enhancement, and lymphadenopathy of 1\\u20133 cm in diameter.\\n\\n,\\n\\nAlthough the radiologic findings associated with IgG4-related disease may be nonspecific, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with this disease process to help raise suspicion for this difficult to diagnose disease. In the head and neck, the most common sites of involvement include the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, perineural involvement, lymph nodes, and the pituitary gland. Radiologists assume an important role by initially suggesting the disease, followed by further diagnostic investigation.\\n\\nFluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is currently used to investigate subclinical and multiorgan disease for specific cases of IgG4RD,\\n\\nin a similar process that allows IgG4-related pancreatitis to be diagnosed without tissue biopsy\\n\\n. Treatment is still controversial, but corticosteroids are accepted as first-line therapy for IgG4RD, including pediatric population\\n\\n, with response rates generally beginning after 2 weeks of treatment. Recurrent salivary swelling has been reported at a rate of 24% after complete clinical remission\\n\\nand tends to be higher among younger patients\\n\\n. Longstanding periods without treatment may lead to irreversible fibrotic damage\\n\\n,\\n\\n. In addition, IgG4RD has been associated with various types of malignancy, particularly in individuals with high-serum IgG4 titer, regardless of treatment with corticosteroids.\\n\\nConclusion IgG4RD is a systemic disease that can affect many different organs. Although the imaging features of IgG4RD can be nonspecific, radiologists play an important role in suggesting this disease, as patients respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Inclusion of IgG4RD in the differential of pediatric patients with bilateral homogenous salivary gland involvement can help avoid delayed diagnosis as well as avoid unnecessary procedures.\",\n          \"1 Introduction Epidermoid cysts (EC) are slow-growing, benign lesions resulting from the entrapment of epidermal cells in the dermis . While they are commonly found on the face, scalp, and trunk, penile localization is extremely rare, representing between 0.01\\u00a0% and 0.1\\u00a0% of penile masses . This prevalence is an estimate, as the incidence is difficult to assess due to the rarity of cases, with fewer than 55 published cases of penile EC worldwide . This report examines the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical techniques of penile EC, comparing it with the latest 10 case reports [\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n] on surgical methods and follow-up outcomes. 2 Case presentation A 35-year-old married male, with no significant medical history, no history of multiple sexual partners, and a history of ritual circumcision in childhood, presented with an asymptomatic mass on the lateral left side of the penis, which had been present since 2019. Over the past 8\\u00a0months, the mass gradually increased in size and was associated with intense pruritus. The patient reported discomfort during sexual intercourse and a negative impact on his self-image. There was no pain, discharge, or signs of infection. On clinical examination, a firm, mobile, non-tender, well-circumscribed, and superficial subcutaneous lesion measuring 2.5\\u00a0cm\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a01.8\\u00a0cm was observed on the middle third of the left lateral aspect of the penis. No signs of inflammation, such as erythema or ulceration, were noted, and no palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The corpora cavernosa were palpated freely, and the spongy body was palpated distally ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Preoperative appearance of the lesion: The lesion appears as a well-circumscribed, firm mass located on the middle third of the left lateral aspect of the penis, with no signs of ulceration (black arrow). Fig. 1 Serological tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, VDRL, and TPHA were negative, excluding common infectious causes. At this stage, the differential diagnosis included epidermoid carcinoma, Bowen's disease, adnexal tumor, leiomyoma, and cutaneous tuberculosis. A biopsy was necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A cutaneous biopsy was performed, consisting of two skin flaps measuring 1.5\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a00.3\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a00.3\\u00a0cm and 1.6\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a00.9\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a00.9\\u00a0cm. Histopathological examination revealed acanthotic epidermal lining with orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and focal parakeratosis. Spongiosis was noted, and the underlying dermis contained a cystic formation lined by squamous epithelium without cytonuclear atypia, but with keratin flakes. The cyst was surrounded by a moderate polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate, both perivascular and interstitial. No pathogenic agents were identified with PAS staining. The final diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst, with spongiotic dermatitis likely being an artifact due to secondary irritation from the patient's frequent scratching. The spongiosis was localized and not accompanied by signs of infection or primary inflammatory pathology. This is not typically associated with epidermoid cysts and suggests a reaction to mechanical irritation. Therefore, further radiological assessment was deemed unnecessary. The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with sedation. The procedure was performed through an elliptical incision following the natural skin lines, ensuring complete excision of the lesion along with the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. Careful hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery, and the wound was closed in layers with absorbable sutures for the deep tissue and interrupted absorbable sutures for the skin. The excised specimen measured 2.7\\u00a0cm by 2.0\\u00a0cm ( Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 Intraoperative findings: (A) Lesion excision in progress, revealing well-defined margins with meticulous dissection (white arrow); (B) post-excision view of the penis, demonstrating an intact surgical site with preserved corpora cavernosa (white arrow); (C) final appearance after wound closure (white arrow). Fig. 2 Definitive histopathological analysis showed a dermal cystic formation with a cutaneous lining. The lining was bordered by regular, mature squamous epithelium, and a well-defined granular layer was noted. The cyst lumen contained concentric lamellae of keratin. The dermis was loosely fibrous, with rare mononuclear inflammatory cells composed primarily of mature lymphocytes, traversed by a fine capillary network. Rare atrophic follicles were noted, surrounded by concentric fibrosis. The final diagnosis confirmed an epidermoid cyst, associated with follicular keratosis ( Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Macroscopic and histopathological findings: (A) Macroscopic view of the excised specimen, showing a well-circumscribed, encapsulated mass with a smooth outer surface; (B) histopathological examination at low magnification (HE staining) showing cystic structure lined by stratified squamous epithelium with lamellated keratin in the lumen and no atypia. Fig. 3 The postoperative period was uneventful, with complete healing observed in three weeks. At the six-month follow-up, no recurrence was noted, and the patient reported a high level of satisfaction with both functional and aesthetic outcomes ( Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Appearance at 6\\u00a0months. Lateral and frontal views showing the healed surgical site with no signs of recurrence, smooth skin, and normal penile appearance (A: lateral, B: frontal). Fig. 4 3 Discussion EC are benign lesions derived from the epidermis, accounting for approximately 1\\u00a0% of cutaneous tumors and up to 85\\u201390\\u00a0% of benign cystic skin tumors . Penile localization of EC is extremely rare, representing between 0.01\\u00a0% and 0.1\\u00a0% of penile masses . This prevalence is an estimate, as the incidence is difficult to assess due to the rarity of cases, with fewer than 55 published cases of penile EC . EC primarily affect men, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1. The peak incidence is between 30 and 50\\u00a0years, although cases span from infancy to old age. Prevalence ranges from 0.1\\u00a0% to 0.7\\u00a0% . Most cysts are found on the trunk (35\\u00a0%), head and neck (25\\u00a0%), and extremities (20\\u00a0%). Genital involvement is rare, accounting for <0.01\\u00a0% of cases, based on reviews of over 2500 skin lesions . EC occur when epidermal cells are trapped within the dermis, resulting in a gradual buildup of keratin in a cystic cavity, which is lined by stratified squamous epithelium with a defined granular layer . The pathogenesis of these cysts can be attributed to three main mechanisms. Post-traumatic epidermal inclusion is responsible for approximately 50\\u00a0% of cases, often following penetrating injuries, surgical procedures, or chronic friction that displaces epidermal cells into the dermis . Obstruction of cutaneous appendages, such as sebaceous glands and hair follicles, accounts for nearly 30\\u00a0% of cases . This typically occurs in conditions like acne vulgaris, hidradenitis suppurativa, or pilonidal disease, where follicular occlusion leads to the accumulation of cellular debris and cyst formation . Congenital or genetic factors contribute to around 20\\u00a0% of cases, with EC sometimes arising in association with developmental anomalies such as branchial cleft remnants or underlying genetic conditions like Gardner's syndrome, which involves multiple epidermoid cysts, desmoid tumors, and colorectal polyposis . At the molecular level, studies have revealed mutations in the PTCH1 gene, a critical regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, in certain congenital forms of epidermoid cysts . These PTCH1 mutations result in abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation, making individuals more susceptible to the formation of multiple cysts. Additionally, disruptions in other key signaling pathways, such as Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin and TGF-\\u03b2, have been implicated in the altered proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, particularly in sporadic cases . Follicular keratosis, also known as keratosis pilaris, is a condition characterized by abnormal keratinization of hair follicles . It is typically observed on the upper arms, thighs, face, and buttocks, but genital involvement is rare . When it does occur, it is usually asymptomatic and manifests as small, rough, keratotic papules. The exact prevalence of follicular keratosis in the genital region is not well established, but it is considered exceedingly uncommon, often in association with other dermatological conditions . Although benign, follicular keratosis must be differentiated from more serious conditions, including malignancies, during evaluation . Imaging is typically unnecessary for well-circumscribed superficial lesions, as clinical examination and histopathology are usually sufficient . However, if malignancy is suspected or if the lesion has atypical characteristics, further investigation may be needed. In such cases, high-frequency ultrasound (>15\\u00a0MHz) is commonly used, revealing an anechoic or hypoechoic homogeneous structure with well-defined walls and no vascular flow on Doppler, suggesting a benign nature . This imaging modality is helpful for deeper or more complex cysts. MRI may be considered if malignancy is suspected, as it shows characteristic T2 hyperintensity, which could indicate tumor tissue or inflammation . The differential diagnosis for EC includes various conditions. Frequent benign lesions are condyloma acuminata (HPV), accounting for up to 70\\u00a0% of benign penile lesions, most commonly on the glans (50\\u00a0%), shaft (30\\u00a0%), and coronal sulcus (20\\u00a0%) . Primary syphilis, affecting <5\\u00a0% of penile lesions, typically presents as a chancre on the glans (50\\u00a0%), shaft (30\\u00a0%), or prepuce (20\\u00a0%). Sebaceous cysts make up 5\\u201310\\u00a0% of benign masses, typically on the shaft (60\\u201370\\u00a0%) or glans (10\\u201315\\u00a0%) . Lipomas, also 5\\u201310\\u00a0% of benign masses, are mainly located on the shaft (70\\u00a0%) or scrotum (20\\u00a0%) . Pilonidal disease is rare on the penis but can occur on the shaft in under 5\\u00a0% of cases . Leiomyomas, representing 1\\u20132\\u00a0% of benign penile tumors, are found mostly on the shaft (80\\u00a0%) or glans (10\\u00a0%) . Rare but significant lesions include squamous cell carcinoma (95\\u00a0% of penile cancers), most often on the glans (50\\u00a0%), prepuce (30\\u00a0%), or shaft (20\\u00a0%) . Bowen's disease occurs in 1\\u20135\\u00a0% of penile cancers and may progress to invasive carcinoma . Penile melanoma, <1\\u00a0% of penile cancers, presents as a pigmented lesion on the glans (60\\u00a0%), shaft (30\\u00a0%), or prepuce (10\\u00a0%) . Very rare conditions include cutaneous tuberculosis (<1\\u00a0% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis), presenting as a painless lesion on the glans (60\\u00a0%) or shaft (40\\u00a0%) . Rare genetic conditions like Gardner's syndrome and basal cell nevus syndrome may cause EC on the penis, typically on the shaft (60\\u00a0%) or glans (20\\u00a0%), requiring monitoring for associated malignancies, including colorectal cancer . We opted for surgical excision, the most common approach in recent case reports [ 2 ,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n]. Surgical excision is the primary treatment for EC, with a success rate of 98\\u2013100\\u00a0% . Elliptical excision is the standard technique used in 90\\u00a0% of cases, while marsupialization is used for cysts larger than 5\\u00a0cm. CO2 laser excision, associated with a recurrence rate of <3\\u00a0%, is employed to reduce scarring . Postoperative complications are rare, including infections (2\\u20135\\u00a0%), hypertrophic scarring (3\\u20135\\u00a0%), and transient erectile dysfunction (1\\u00a0%) . Histopathological examination confirms the diagnosis of EC, which feature stratified squamous epithelium without atypia, distinguishing them from malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma . The cyst contains lamellated keratin and, in 20\\u201340\\u00a0% of cases, a moderate inflammatory infiltrate . In the current case, histopathology showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, a polymorphic infiltrate, and no atypia, confirming the lesion's benign nature. Unlike dermoid cysts, EC lack adnexal structures and have a lining of 6\\u201315 squamous cell layers. The cyst contents consist of keratin, not sebaceous material, and inflammation is common in ruptured cases, leading to granuloma formation . Our favorable postoperative outcomes, align with results seen in similar cases [\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n]. The prognosis is excellent, with a recurrence rate of <5\\u00a0%, and no malignant transformation observed after a median follow-up of 5\\u00a0years . Functional and aesthetic satisfaction is reported in 95\\u00a0% of cases . Recurrence occurs in 2\\u20135\\u00a0% of cases, especially after incomplete excision . 4 Conclusion Penile EC are rare lesions. Accurate diagnosis is vital to rule out malignancies. Complete excision ensures excellent functional and aesthetic outcomes. Follow-up beyond six months is crucial to monitor for rare recurrences and ensure early detection of complications.

His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C 5.9%), chronic rhinosinusitis, and a prior enlarged left submandibular lymph node in 2014 that was aspirated and deemed reactive without evidence of lymphoma. He otherwise reported good health. On examination, he had 4+ bilateral upper and lower eyelid swelling and induration\\u2014worse on the left\\u2014causing mechanical ptosis (MRD1 0 mm in each eye) and proptosis. A nontender, enlarged left submandibular lymph node was palpated; pupils and extraocular movements were normal. Laboratory studies showed total IgG 2149 mg/dL (reference 603\\u20131613), total IgE 1026 IU/mL (reference 6\\u2013495), and IgG4 621 mg/dL (reference 2\\u201396). Evaluations for thyroid disease, ANCA-associated vasculitides, sarcoidosis, necrotizing myopathy, and infection were not consistent with those conditions. MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast demonstrated severe bilateral proptosis with straightening of the optic nerves; diffuse enlargement of the lacrimal glands and extraocular muscles; inflammatory changes and stranding of the eyelids and retrobulbar fat with crowding at the orbital apex; and diffuse sinus inflammatory disease, most pronounced in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. Based on these findings, a diagnostic left anterior orbitotomy with biopsy of the orbital fat and lacrimal gland was performed.\",\n          \"A 16-year-old Hispanic male was referred for evaluation of bilateral neck masses noted on routine exam. He first noticed firm swelling beneath his jaw 2 months earlier, with gradual enlargement and no fever, weight loss, night sweats, or pain. Treatment with antibiotics produced no improvement. On exam, firm bilateral submandibular glands measured about 4 cm in diameter; the remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck showed homogeneous enlargement of both submandibular glands without ductal dilation or stones; the parotid and lacrimal glands appeared normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. An open biopsy of the left submandibular gland revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate with mixed B and T cells and reactive secondary follicles, but no evidence of lymphoid neoplasia.

CSD is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and damage to the skin, leading to symptoms such as itching, burning, and pain. The patient's history of travel to various regions with potential exposure to environmental allergens and parasites, as well as his primary immunodeficiency, are consistent with the development of CSD. The negative bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures, as well as the lack of evidence of infection on serologic studies, further support this diagnosis. The presence of nodules, erosions, and ulcers on the extremities, particularly the persistent ulcer on the left second finger, are also characteristic of CSD. The patient's response to antiparasitic and antibacterial agents is also consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's recent surgical amputation of the left second finger due to cellulitis and osteomyelitis suggests that the underlying condition may have progressed to a more severe form of CSD.\n",

Additionally, the patient has a history of a primary immunodeficiency, which is a known risk factor for atopic dermatitis. The patient's skin biopsies show chronic spongiotic dermatitis, acute and chronic folliculitis, and panniculitis, which are all consistent with the findings of atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, the patient' a history of multiple courses of antiparasitic, antibacterial, and antifungal agents, which are commonly used to treat atopic dermatitis. The patient's case also fits with the clinical presentation of atopic dermatitis, which often involves a chronic relapsing course with periods of remission and exacerbation.\n",

            "    A 6-year-old boy from a rural area presented with a one-month history of a progressively enlarging right axillary mass. He denied pain or inflammatory signs but reported limited abduction of the right upper limb. He was initially diagnosed with pyogenic adenitis and treated with cephalexin without improvement. He also described transient enlargements of cervical and inguinal lymph nodes and intermittent arthralgias of the wrists, ankles, and knees, all resolving spontaneously. His medical history was unremarkable, and immunizations were up to date. He had frequent contact with cattle and raw milk but no history of cat exposure or sick contacts. On examination, vital signs were normal. There were small palpable lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain and right supraclavicular region. In the right axilla, there was a well-defined, 4 cm lymph node without overlying inflammation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a normal complete blood count, normal acute-phase reactants, normal renal and liver function tests, and negative antinuclear antibodies. Neck ultrasound demonstrated multiple enlarged lymph nodes; an initial lymph node biopsy revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable, and chest CT confirmed multiple lymphadenopathies in the right axilla. Tuberculin skin testing and gastric aspirates for acid-fast bacilli staining and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures were all negative. Serologic tests for Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Epstein–Barr virus, Brucella, and HIV were all nonreactive.\n",

            "    </answer> [/INST] Based on the symptoms, examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's age, gender, and lack of cardiac risk factors make this diagnosis less likely, but the presence of retrosternal burning sensation, elevated troponin levels, and mild mid-LAD stenosis on coronary multislice CT angiography support this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's ECG showed a tall R wave in V1 and repeat ECGs and troponin levels were unchanged also support this diagnosis. However, since the patient's troponin levels were only slightly elevated and there were no other signs of myocardial damage, it is possible that the patient may have had a benign variant of ACS or another cause of chest pain.\n",

Examination revealed decreased air entry and crepitations over the left chest and tenderness in the right hypochondrium without organomegaly. Laboratory tests showed a WBC count of 12,700/mm3 (neutrophil predominant), random blood sugar 6.8 mmol/L, urea 8.9 mmol/L, creatinine 202 µmol/L, sodium 119.4 mEq/L, and potassium 3.2 mEq/L. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple small hypoechoic cystic lesions in the right hepatic lobe with minimal ascites. He was started empirically on voriconazole, metronidazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Sputum cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, but urine, blood, and wound cultures were sterile. Sputum specimens were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungal elements on KOH. After nine days of treatment without improvement, meropenem was initiated. A high-resolution CT scan showed multiple thick-walled cavities in the left upper and lower lobes with fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, and antitubercular therapy was added while meropenem was continued. An ultrasound-guided aspiration of the liver abscess yielded frank pus, which was sent for microbiological evaluation.\n",

AMS is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is caused by an obstruction of one or more of the major blood vessels supplying the small intestine, which can lead to ischemia and inflammation of the intestinal tissue. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with AMS, and the imaging findings show evidence of a thrombosis in the main portal vein and superior mesenteric vein, which are two of the major blood vessels that supply the small intestine. The patient' a history of Brazilian jiu-jitsu may suggest a traumatic cause of the thrombosis, although other possible causes of AMS include infectious, autoimmune, or idiopathic etiologies. Further evaluation and management of the patient will require further diagnostic tests and a multidisciplinary approach involving medical professionals such as gastroenterologists, radiologists, and hematologists.\n",

            "    A 34-year-old woman (G3P3) presented with a 4-month history of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and low back pain. She denied weight loss or systemic symptoms and took no medications. On examination the abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Pelvic examination revealed a normal uterus; the left ovary was enlarged and non-tender, while the right ovary was normal. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous left ovarian mass measuring 7.0 × 5.0 × 5.0 cm.

            "    A 73-year-old man with stable angina pectoris was admitted for percutaneous coronary intervention of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He had hypertension, was an ex-smoker, and had undergone bypass surgery 5 years earlier, but all grafts were now occluded. Blood pressure was 134/80 mm Hg, heart rate 72 beats/min, and physical examination—including jugular venous pressure, lung and heart auscultation, and leg inspection—was unremarkable. Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%, normal wall motion, and no hypertrophy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Coronary angiography revealed 75% stenosis of the left main trunk and 90% calcified stenosis of the proximal LAD; myocardial bridging was not evident. A transfemoral approach was performed under ultrasound guidance, with a 7 Fr sheath in the right common femoral artery. After rotational atherectomy, an everolimus-eluting stent was implanted from the left main trunk to the proximal LAD. During stent deployment, his blood pressure fell and heart rate rose. At that moment, angiography demonstrated newly apparent myocardial bridging in the mid-LAD. There was no visible swelling at the puncture site. Laboratory studies then showed a haemoglobin drop from 11.3 g/dL to 7.0 g/dL. We suspected puncture-site haemorrhage and immediately performed lower limb arteriography.\n",

The presence of multiple splenic lesions, drenching sweats, and left upper-quadrant abdominal pain are consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and other laboratory abnormalities further supports this diagnosis. The magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography–computed tomography findings, including the mild uptake in one splenic-hilum lesion and increased activity in several bone sites, are also characteristic of Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n",

He had smoked 56 pack-years and had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in adolescence and chronic pyothorax treated with intravenous antibiotics one year earlier. His temperature was 37.2°C. Pulmonary examination revealed wheezes and reduced air entry in the right mid-lung; no lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (12,500/µL), normal lactate dehydrogenase (223 IU/L), mildly elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (5.8 ng/mL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (575 U/mL). Chest radiography demonstrated hypolucency of the right middle lung field. CT of the chest revealed chronic pyothorax with calcified foci in the right lung and a mass within the bronchus intermedius, without mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Flexible bronchoscopy identified a smooth, pedunculated endobronchial tumor obstructing the bronchus intermedius. Biopsy showed predominantly small atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy specimen revealed positivity for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7; negativity for CD8, CD20, and CD30; and a low Ki-67 labeling index. PET-CT demonstrated intense uptake (maximum standardized uptake value, 20.6) confined to the endobronchial lesion, with no abnormal uptake at the site of pyothorax, mediastinal nodes, or elsewhere.\n",

He had smoked 56 pack-years and had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in adolescence and chronic pyothorax treated with intravenous antibiotics one year earlier. His temperature was 37.2°C. Pulmonary examination revealed wheezes and reduced air entry in the right mid-lung; no lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (12,500/µL), normal lactate dehydrogenase (223 IU/L), mildly elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (5.8 ng/mL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (575 U/mL). Chest radiography demonstrated hypolucency of the right middle lung field. CT of the chest revealed chronic pyothorax with calcified foci in the right lung and a mass within the bronchus intermedius, without mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Flexible bronchoscopy identified a smooth, pedunculated endobronchial tumor obstructing the bronchus intermedius. Biopsy showed predominantly small atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy specimen revealed positivity for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7; negativity for CD8, CD20, and CD30; and a low Ki-67 labeling index. PET-CT demonstrated intense uptake (maximum standardized uptake value, 20.6) confined to the endobronchial lesion, with no abnormal uptake at the site of pyothorax, mediastinal nodes, or elsewhere.\n",

This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for beta-globin, leading to a deficiency of this protein. The patient's symptoms of reddish discoloration of his nappies and clothes, breath-holding spells, and dark urine are consistent with beta-thalassemia.

This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for beta-globin, leading to a deficiency of this protein. The patient's symptoms of reddish discoloration of his nappies and clothes, breath-holding spells, and dark urine are consistent with beta-thalassemia.

Initial laboratory evaluation was normal. A venous blood gas showed pH 7.36, pCO₂ 18.4 mmHg, bicarbonate 11.1 mmol/L, and chloride 125 mmol/L.

She remained febrile (39 °C) despite antipyretics, with sinus tachycardia (210 bpm); a fluid bolus and ceftriaxone were administered, but infection workup was negative. Urinalysis revealed pH 5, glycosuria (67 mg/dL), and ketonuria (150 mg/dL).

The patient's recurrent fasting hypoglycemia, elevated insulin levels, and the positive findings on the triple-phase CT of the pancreas and the 68Ga-DOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT suggest the presence of a pancreatic tumor. The selective arterial calcium stimulation test with hepatic venous sampling further supports this diagnosis by demonstrating a hyperfunctional lesion in the body and/or tail region of the pancreas.\n",

            "    An 18‐year‐old unmarried woman presented with intermittent low‐grade fever and a perineal swelling of two years’ duration that had slowly increased in size. She was a migrant from Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh. On examination, she was afebrile with no lymphadenopathy. Local inspection revealed a 5 × 6 cm soft, polypoidal growth arising from the left labium minus with rugose overlying skin. A clinical diagnosis of fibrolipoma was made. Fine‐needle aspiration of the lesion yielded hypocellular smears with occasional lymphocytes in a proteinaceous background. The lesion was then excised. Grossly, it measured 5.2 × 3.4 × 2.2 cm, was polypoidal and firm, and on section was gray-white to gray-yellow. Microscopic examination showed a polypoidal lesion covered by acanthotic epidermis; the dermis and subcutis had dense collagenization with numerous dilated lymphatics. In the deep dermis there were a few noncaseating granulomas and foreign-body giant cells. A patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils was present. Ziehl–Neelsen, Grocott's methenamine silver, and periodic acid–Schiff stains were negative for organisms, and examination of a buffy‐coat preparation showed no microfilariae.\n",

FGD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, chronic inflammation, and recurrent abscesses. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the innate immune response, leading to impaired phagocytosis and clearance of bacterial pathogens. The patient's history of a perineal swelling that has gradually increased in size over several years, along with the presence of a polypoidal lesion with a firm, gray-white appearance, consistent with a fibrogranulomatous lesion. The patient' a history of being a migrant from Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, which is an area known to have a high incidence of FGD, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's fine-needle aspiration results are consistent with a chronic inflammatory process, with a hypocellular smear and the presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. The patient's negative Ziehl-Neelsen, Grocott's methenamine silver, and periodic acid-Schiff stains suggest that the patient does not have a mycobacterial infection. The patient's buffy coat preparation showing no microfilariae is also consistent with FGD.

The patient's presentation of longstanding nyctalopia and metamorphopsia in both eyes, along with recent difficulty adapting to bright light, are consistent with AMD. The presence of multiple punctate, drusen-like, refractive deposits in the posterior pole and midperiphery, with prominent choroidal vessels in areas of RPE atrophy, is also consistent with AMD. The patient's father has a history of AMD, further supporting this diagnosis. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye is consistent with an advanced stage of AMD. The patient' a negative history of exposure to pentosan polysulfate or hydroxychloroquine, which are known risk factors for AMD. The patient's spectral-domain OCT demonstrates patchy areas of complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy, diffuse choroidal thinning, and hyperreflective dots predominantly in the outer retina and RPE, which are characteristic findings of AMD. The patient's en face OCT localizes hyperreflective crystalline deposits at various retinal levels, some of which were not evident on clinical examination or fundus photography, which is consistent with AMD. The patient's full-field electroretinography shows approximately 50% reduction in rod and cone amplitudes bilaterally, which is consistent with AMD.

            "    A 43-year-old woman presented in July 2013 with a several-month history of weight gain, central obesity, moon facies, facial plethora, easy bruising, muscle wasting and weakness, skin thinning, headache, menstrual irregularity, depressive mood, acne, hirsutism, and osteopenia. An overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test showed serum cortisol levels of 22.5 and 27.1 μg/dL on two separate days (reference <1.8 μg/dL). Late-night salivary cortisol measurements were 14.5 and 24.7 nmol/L (reference <1.0 nmol/L), and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were 472 and 455 μg/24 h (reference <250 μg/24 h). Morning ACTH was 45 pg/mL (reference <46 pg/mL), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was 641 ng/mL (reference 61–337 ng/mL). Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland revealed an 8-mm lesion in the left side of the gland; CT of the chest and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable. After an 8-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, cortisol levels decreased by 83%. At that time, she experienced spontaneous weight loss, return of regular menses, and normalization of late-night salivary cortisol (76 ng/dL; reference <100 ng/dL) and urinary free cortisol (25.1 and 70.0 μg/24 h; reference 3–43 μg/24 h), prompting cancellation of scheduled pituitary surgery. By February 2014, her clinical features and hypercortisolism had recurred. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery in June 2014; no adenoma was identified on pathology. On postoperative day 10, cortisol was 23.4 μg/dL (8–9 AM; reference 6.0–18.4 μg/dL) and ACTH was 41 pg/mL. A bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling was planned but was postponed because of another spontaneous clinical and biochemical remission.\n",

Her medical history included insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, polymyalgia rheumatica treated with prednisolone, bipolar disorder treated with lithium, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. On admission she was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 12,000/mm3 (reference range 5000–10,000), C-reactive protein 400 mg/dL (<4), serum creatinine 4.16 mg/dL (0.5–1.1), and estimated GFR 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 (90–120). Urinalysis revealed no hematuria, pyuria, or proteinuria. A chest CT was normal. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT in the nephrographic phase demonstrated bilaterally enlarged kidneys with perirenal fat stranding, pararenal fluid, small ascites, and patent renal vessels without hydronephrosis or calculi. One hour after contrast administration, a delayed-phase CT showed homogeneous retention of contrast in both kidneys, consistent with a persistent nephrogram.\n",

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, polymyalgia rheumatica, bipolar disorder, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, which could all contribute to the development of acute nephrotoxicity. The patient's laboratory findings suggest a severe infection, which could also lead to acute nephrotoxicity. The patient' a history of taking multiple medications, including prednisolone, lithium, and insulin, which could also contribute to the development of acute nephrotoxicity.

There was no history of trauma or locking episodes. Examination revealed a solitary, firm, fluctuant, immobile, slightly tender 4×3-cm mass over the posteromedial knee without overlying inflammation. Medial joint-line tenderness and a positive McMurray test for a medial meniscus tear were noted; ligaments were stable. Knee range of motion was 0–120°, with pain at terminal flexion. Plain radiographs showed early osteoarthritis of the medial compartment and patellofemoral arthritis. MRI of the knee demonstrated a 3.9×3.0×2.5-cm well-defined cystic lesion medial to the semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles with thin internal septations, hyperintense on T2-weighted and fat-suppressed images and hypointense on T1-weighted images; a horizontal tear of the posterior horn and body of the medial meniscus and an oblique tear in the posterior horn were also seen.\n",

This condition is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process that affects the breast tissue, leading to symptoms such as breast swelling, erythema, and pain. The presence of chronic dermal inflammation on biopsy, along with the absence of any evidence of malignancy, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of progression over several months and the presence of lymphedema in the right breast further supports the diagnosis of CIBD.\n",

The patient ingested a neurotoxic pesticide mixture with suicidal intent, which caused an acute polyneuropathy. Six weeks later, he developed a progressive lower-limb weakness that was consistent with an intermediate syndrome. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid showed normal sugar, protein, and cell counts with absence of oligoclonal bands, and cytology was negative for malignancy. Nerve conduction studies of upper and lower limbs were normal, and MRI of the spine showed mildly roomy CSF space around the dorsal cord without signal changes, suggestive of mild cord atrophy.

She was hemodynamically stable and denied fever or recent infection.

The patient's history of a previous episode of similar symptoms, along with the presence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, are consistent with a diagnosis of ADEM.

            "    A 49-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with 5 months of progressive back pain and 5 days of rapid onset numbness and paralysis in both lower limbs. Neurologic examination revealed marked paresthesia and weakness of proximal and distal muscle groups in both lower extremities (MMT grade 3/5). Plain radiographs of the spine showed a compressive deformity and heterogeneous sclerosis of the T10 vertebra. MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated a T10 vertebral lesion with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, moderately high signal on T2-weighted images, and gadolinium-enhanced axial images revealing extraosseous extensions compressing the spinal cord. Contrast-enhanced CT of the spine confirmed heterogeneous sclerosis and remarkable irregular extraosseous bone proliferation at T10. Whole-body CT (neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis) showed no primary tumor, and blood tests revealed no positive tumor markers. Two days after admission, her lower-limb strength worsened to MMT grade 2/5, and urgent surgical intervention was planned.\n",

The patient's age, lack of significant medical history, and the presence of a compressive deformity and heterogeneous sclerosis on radiographs are consistent with a malignancy. The MRI findings of a T10 vertebral lesion with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, moderately high signal on T2-weighted images, and gadolinium-enhanced axial images revealing extraosseous extensions compressing the spinal cord are also consistent with a malignancy. The contrast-enhanced CT of the spine confirms the presence of heterogeneous sclerosis and remarkable irregular extraosseous bone proliferation at T10, which is consistent with a metastatic process.

            "    A 12-year-old right-handed Hispanic boy presented with chronic intermittent pain on the ulnar side of his left wrist three months after injuring it during baseball practice. Immediately after hitting the ball, he noted diffuse swelling over the ulnar border and limited range of motion due to pain. Initial anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique wrist radiographs were reported as negative, and he was diagnosed with a wrist sprain and immobilized in a brace. After one week, a general orthopaedic surgeon confirmed no evident fractures on repeat radiographs and recommended continued conservative treatment; four additional weeks of splinting provided minimal relief. Referral to physical medicine and rehabilitation led to physical therapy, but the patient continued to experience mild discomfort. New wrist radiographs remained negative. Subsequent MRI demonstrated bone edema and a disruptive linear signal in the hook of the hamate. Upon evaluation in the hand clinic, he reported weakness when gripping a bat and intermittent pain but denied numbness or tingling. Examination revealed tenderness at the ulnar aspect of the wrist, grip strength of 3/5 on the affected side, preserved range of motion without erythema or atrophy, and intact sensation. Hook of hamate pull test elicited moderate pain. Tinel’s sign and Phalen’s test were negative, and the Allen test ruled out ulnar artery compromise.\n",

            "    A 16-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of intermittent, bilateral bloody tearing. Her menarche began at age 13, with regular menstrual cycles and no correlation between episodes of bloody tearing and menses. She had no history of trauma, bleeding diathesis, or hematologic disorders, and there was no relevant family history.\n",
            "\n",
            "On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Findings on slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressures, and funduscopy were normal. Pupils were equal and reactive. There were no foreign bodies, vascular lesions, or lacerations on the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, or in the punctal region. The lacrimal glands were neither enlarged nor tender, and compression of the nasolacrimal ducts did not produce a blood-stained discharge. Nasolacrimal passages were patent.\n",

            "Dacryocystography and gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging of the nasolacrimal canals showed no abnormalities. Intranasal endoscopic evaluation was normal.\n",

            "Two samples of the bloody tears were sent for pathological examination; analysis revealed numerous squamous cells and dysplastic cells but no endometrial tissue. Hematologic workup, including platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and a full coagulation panel, was within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a 1–2 cm ovarian cyst. Further investigations for systemic or ocular causes were unrevealing.\n",

This condition can be caused by various factors such as allergies, dry eye syndrome, or an underlying medical condition such as a thyroid disorder. However, given the patient's history of intermittent, bilateral bloody tearing without any known cause, it is possible that she may have a rare condition called \"idiopathic recurrent epiphora\" which is characterized by recurrent episodes of bloody tearing without any identifiable underlying cause.\n",

            "    A 17-year-old female presented with a 3-year history of a slowly enlarging lesion on the posterior tongue, associated only with a persistent foreign-body sensation and no pain, bleeding, dysphagia, voice change, or respiratory symptoms. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable, with no family history of malignancy and no tobacco use. On examination, a single, well-defined, smooth-surfaced, white mass approximately 1 × 1 cm was visible on the posterior third of the dorsal tongue with protrusion. The lesion was hard and non-tender on palpation, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy.

This is because the patient presents with a slow-growing, painless, and non-dysphagic nodule on the posterior tongue that has been present for three years.

While the patient does not report any other symptoms such as dysphonia or difficulty swallowing, these are common presenting features of PTC. The fact that the patient has no family history of malignancy and no tobacco use also supports this diagnosis.

Chest CT showed a 25×18 mm nodule in the left upper lobe and a bulky subcarinal lymph node invading the right main bronchus. Bronchoscopy confirmed endobronchial tumor stenosis. He was diagnosed with stage IIIA squamous cell lung carcinoma (T1bN2M0), moderately differentiated, p40-positive, with no EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement.

            "    A 68-year-old man was found on a routine health check to have an asymptomatic mass in the uncus of the pancreas. He had no history of chronic pancreatitis or other relevant medical conditions, and tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9) were within normal limits. Enhanced abdominal CT showed a well-demarcated 4.2 × 3.9 cm lesion comprising cystic areas of iso- to low-density surrounded by an area of extremely low density resembling adipose tissue. MRI and MRCP demonstrated multilocular cysts 1–several millimeters in diameter within the uncus; the main pancreatic duct was not dilated, and there was no communication between the lesion and the duct. On this basis, a benign tumor such as lipoma, dermoid cyst, or another rare benign cystic lesion was initially suspected. The patient developed a contrast allergy, so surveillance with plain CT and MRI was undertaken. Twenty-one months later, CT showed a slight decrease in overall size (3.9 × 3.6 cm) with smaller cysts and a larger solid component, and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a honeycomb-like appearance. At 28 months, plain CT showed an increase in size to 4.2 × 3.3 cm and MRCP revealed more and larger cysts without ductal invasion. On MRI at that time, the cystic component was low intensity on T1-weighted imaging, iso-intense on T2, and high on T2 fat-saturation, whereas the surrounding solid tissue was iso-intense on T1, iso- to high on T2, and suppressed on fat-saturated sequences—suggesting fluid-filled cysts enveloped by fat. Coronal T2 imaging showed ringed multilocular cysts with a smooth outer margin and a small internal nodule, findings that raised concern for malignant transformation of an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.\n",

            "    A 68-year-old man was found on a routine health check to have an asymptomatic mass in the uncus of the pancreas. He had no history of chronic pancreatitis or other relevant medical conditions, and tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9) were within normal limits. Enhanced abdominal CT showed a well-demarcated 4.2 × 3.9 cm lesion comprising cystic areas of iso- to low-density surrounded by an area of extremely low density resembling adipose tissue. MRI and MRCP demonstrated multilocular cysts 1–several millimeters in diameter within the uncus; the main pancreatic duct was not dilated, and there was no communication between the lesion and the duct. On this basis, a benign tumor such as lipoma, dermoid cyst, or another rare benign cystic lesion was initially suspected. The patient developed a contrast allergy, so surveillance with plain CT and MRI was undertaken. Twenty-one months later, CT showed a slight decrease in overall size (3.9 × 3.6 cm) with smaller cysts and a larger solid component, and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a honeycomb-like appearance. At 28 months, plain CT showed an increase in size to 4.2 × 3.3 cm and MRCP revealed more and larger cysts without ductal invasion.

The patient's symptoms of malaise, fever, and limping, along with the laboratory findings of elevated CRP and ESR, support this diagnosis. The imaging findings of a small effusion on hip ultrasound and an MRI showing a collection between the iliac blade and iliacus muscle are also consistent with osteomyelitis.\n",

            "    A previously well 3-year-old girl presented with a 6-day history of malaise, vomiting, and intermittent fevers. Five days before presentation she developed a limp that progressed until she refused to weight bear on the left side because of pain. There was no history of trauma. On examination she was tachycardic (heart rate 154 bpm) and febrile (temperature 38.1°C in the emergency department; 38.9°C recorded by the referring physician). She held the left hip in flexion and would not bear weight; there was no erythema or swelling of the groin or lower limb. Laboratory studies showed a normal renal profile, C-reactive protein 77 mg/L (peaking at 125 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 76 mm/h (peaking at 80 mm/h), white cell count 9.3×10^9/L, and neutrophils 5.0×10^9/L. Blood cultures remained sterile. Pelvic and left knee radiographs were normal. Hip ultrasound demonstrated a very small left-sided effusion. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 1.5×0.9×4.5 cm collection between the left iliac blade and the iliacus muscle, with surrounding muscle edema and inflammatory changes tracking into the groin.\n",

The pain was blunt in character and of moderate severity. Her medical history was notable for dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. On examination, there was epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies were within normal limits (white blood cells 4.8 × 10^9/L, red blood cells 4.9 × 10^12/L, hemoglobin 142 g/L, platelets 300 × 10^9/L). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed ileocolic intussusception with a polypoid mass in the cecum measuring 4.5 × 2.2 cm extending to the hepatic flexure. Colonoscopy reduced the intussusception and demonstrated a large pedunculated polyp in the cecum. Biopsy of the lesion was negative for dysplasia. Given the possibility of cecal malignancy, she agreed to undergo a laparoscopic ileocecal resection.\n",

DIC is a potentially life-threatening complication characterized by the activation of the clotting system, leading to thrombosis and embolization in various organs. It is often associated with sepsis, trauma, obstetric complications, or malignancy. In this case, the patient had sepsis due to pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which triggered DIC. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, negative direct antiglobulin test and complement testing, schistocytes on peripheral smear, and up-trending eosinophil count are all consistent with DIC.

Osteosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that typically occurs in children and adolescents, often presenting with a painless mass or lump in the bone. In this case, the patient's chronic, destructive lesion at the left lung apex, along with the imaging findings of multiple cavitary pulmonary nodules and bone destruction, are consistent with osteosarcoma. The patient's recent weight loss and shoulder pain also support this diagnosis. While other conditions such as tuberculosis or fungal infection may cause similar symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's negative oral examination and lack of overlying skin changes or chest wall swelling.\n",

Osteosarcoma is a primary bone cancer that commonly affects children and adolescents, often presenting with pain, weight loss, and limited joint mobility. It typically involves the long bones, such as the femur or humerus, but can also occur in other sites, including the lungs. The characteristic radiographic finding of osteosarcoma is the presence of osteoid or mineralized cartilage within the tumor, which can be seen on X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. In addition, osteosarcoma frequently metastasizes to the lungs, resulting in nodular opacities on chest imaging.

            "    A 58-year-old woman with no pre-existing medical conditions presented to the emergency department with a slowly progressive reddish skin alteration in the right interdigital space. Eleven days earlier, while performing necropsies on 6-month-old geese in a veterinary laboratory, a sharp rib fragment penetrated her glove between digits II and III. The same day, four geese from a flock of 350 died suddenly without prior clinical signs. Cloacal swabs were tested with a rapid avian influenza and Newcastle disease antigen kit and were negative. Necropsy of two carcasses revealed dehydration, chronic ulcerative bilateral pododermatitis, multiple pericardial hemorrhages in one bird, congested livers and spleens, and a reticular pattern in the kidneys; parasitology was negative. Culture of heart, liver, and lung on sheep blood agar identified Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (scores 2.02–2.15). \n",
            "\n",
            "From day 1 after the injury, the patient noted a localized erythematous maculopapular discoloration at the wound site. On day 11 she presented; she was afebrile and in good general condition and reported no systemic symptoms. Examination showed a strictly delimited erythematous maculopapular lesion between the right digits II and III without swelling or pain, accompanied by mild pruritus. Routine laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry) were unremarkable, and blood cultures remained sterile.\n",

This is a bacterial infection caused by E. rhusiopathiae, which is commonly found in animals such as pigs and geese. The patient's history of handling geese and the presence of a sharp rib fragment that penetrated her glove suggest a possible exposure to this bacteria. The patient's symptoms of a localized erythematous maculopapular lesion on the right interdigital space are consistent with the presentation of erysipeloid.

Laboratory studies were notable for an elevated prostate-specific antigen level of 409 ng/mL; other results were unremarkable. On digital rectal examination, the rectal lumen was narrowed and rigid. Sigmoidoscopy revealed luminal narrowing of the mid to lower rectum with grossly indurated, non-ulcerated mucosa. Contrast-enhanced CT showed circumferential rectal wall thickening (mean thickness, 1.3 cm) with marked homogeneous enhancement and mild perirectal fat stranding. Pelvic MRI demonstrated concentric thickening of the mid to lower rectum (length, 6–7 cm) with stratification on coronal and sagittal T2-weighted images. On axial T2-weighted images, the rectal wall showed three layers: an isointense middle layer and hypointense inner and outer layers. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed a corresponding concentric ring pattern with restricted diffusion in the middle layer. The prostate gland was enlarged, showing a diffuse infiltrative lesion with low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images and a low apparent diffusion coefficient value. The left seminal vesicle also had low signal intensity, and bilateral external iliac lymph nodes were enlarged.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a distal esophageal mass; biopsy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Staging PET/CT demonstrated distal esophageal wall thickening with uptake extending into the proximal stomach but no brain lesions. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by en bloc esophagectomy with cervical esophagostomy, pyloroplasty, and feeding-tube placement. On admission to the acute rehabilitation unit, he was found to have new left homonymous hemianopsia and confusion with decreased initiation. An MRI of the brain disclosed a 5.2×3.8×5 cm mass in the right parietal–occipital lobe. According to the radiology department report, the lesion was “likely a primary brain neoplasm, such as a neural or glial tumor, or lymphoma, but less likely a focus of metastatic disease, given its appearance.” However, according to the oncology department evaluation, the lesion was “more consistent with a metastatic tumor than a primary brain lesion.”\n",

His white blood cell count and C‐reactive protein level were normal. Noncontrast and contrast‐enhanced CT of the brain showed no fluid collection. Lumbar puncture revealed 253 leukocytes/µL (65% polymorphonuclear) without organism growth; blood cultures were sterile. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole, but fevers persisted despite broad‐spectrum coverage. On hospital day 14, with persistent fevers and a suspicion that his bone flap was infected, he underwent reopening of the posterior fossa craniotomy wound and removal of the bone flap. The procedure was confined to the extradural compartment, although there was intraoperative CSF loss. Bone‐flap cultures and PCR were negative for infection. After surgery, he developed bilateral lower‐motor‐neuron facial weakness (House–Brackmann grade 4 bilaterally), mild slurred speech, and a left abducens nerve palsy. Limb strength, reflexes, and sensation were normal; gait was moderately ataxic. MRI of the brain on postoperative day 2 showed a FLAIR hyperintensity within the floor of the fourth ventricle at the dorsal pons, involving the facial colliculus.\n",

It is characterized by a combination of neurological deficits such as facial weakness, speech impairment, and limb ataxia. The patient's history of resection of a left cerebellar hemangioblastoma and subsequent craniotomy may have contributed to the development of PFS. The FLAIR hyperintensity seen on MRI is consistent with edema or inflammation in the affected area. While the patient's bone-flap cultures and PCR were negative for infection, it is possible that the patient had an underlying bacterial or viral infection that caused the PFS. Treatment for PFS typically involves supportive care, such as pain management and physical therapy, as well as surgical intervention to remove any damaged tissue or relieve pressure on the affected area.\n",

            "    A 39‐year‐old man with a history of resection of a left cerebellar hemangioblastoma 8 weeks earlier presented with a 10‐day history of fever (up to 38.7°C), fatigue, and dizziness. His white blood cell count and C‐reactive protein level were normal. Noncontrast and contrast‐enhanced CT of the brain showed no fluid collection. Lumbar puncture revealed 253 leukocytes/µL (65% polymorphonuclear) without organism growth; blood cultures were sterile. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole, but fevers persisted despite broad‐spectrum coverage. On hospital day 14, with persistent fevers and a suspicion that his bone flap was infected, he underwent reopening of the posterior fossa craniotomy wound and removal of the bone flap. The procedure was confined to the extradural compartment, although there was intraoperative CSF loss. Bone‐flap cultures and PCR were negative for infection. After surgery, he developed bilateral lower‐motor‐neuron facial weakness (House–Brackmann grade 4 bilaterally), mild slurred speech, and a left abducens nerve palsy. Limb strength, reflexes, and sensation were normal; gait was moderately ataxic. MRI of the brain on postoperative day 2 showed a FLAIR hyperintensity within the floor of the fourth ventricle at the dorsal pons, involving the facial colliculus.\n",

The patient's history of end-stage renal disease and ongoing treatment with peritoneal dialysis puts him at risk for developing NDI, which is characterized by a sudden onset of polyuria and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's presentation of facial pain, blistering, unsteady gait, and visual hallucinations are consistent with a drug reaction, specifically a case of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which is a severe form of drug reaction that affects multiple organ systems. The patient' a history of receiving both acyclovir and valacyclovir concurrently for 2 days may have contributed to the development of SJS. The patient's laboratory findings of elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels, as well as a low serum sodium level, suggest a possible case of acute NDI. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a high protein level, which could be indicative of a drug-induced encephalopathy. The patient's neuroimaging results show no evidence of a primary neurological disorder.

            "    A 62-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (diagnosed in 1998), refractory to multiple lines of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, began treatment with alemtuzumab and dexamethasone in December 2011. Three weeks after alemtuzumab initiation, he was hospitalized for invasive aspergillosis involving lung, eye, and brain, treated with voriconazole. Six weeks after the first alemtuzumab dose, he developed profuse, watery diarrhea persisting intermittently for over 12 weeks. There was no blood or mucus in the stools, no abdominal pain, vomiting, or systemic myalgia. He had no travel history, no known exposure to outbreaks, and no family members with similar symptoms. All medications known to cause diarrhea, including voriconazole and alemtuzumab, were discontinued without improvement. Empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam) were administered sequentially but yielded no benefit. Repeated stool cultures for Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Yersinia, as well as assays for protozoans (Microsporidium, Cryptosporidium, Isospora, Giardia lamblia), were negative. Serum PCRs for cytomegalovirus and adenovirus were negative, and stool PCRs for rotavirus and adenovirus were also negative. Colonoscopy revealed no ulcerations, and colonic biopsies showed no cytopathic effects. There was no evidence of gastrointestinal involvement by aspergillosis.\n",

A head CT scan showed a subdural hematoma, and he underwent emergency craniotomy and hematoma evacuation. In the surgical ICU, his neurologic status improved and he was extubated on hospital day 5; he was restless but obeyed commands. He was transferred to the ward on day 7, and received intravenous haloperidol (total dose, 20 mg over 24 hours) for agitation. On day 10, he became febrile to 39.0°C, developed increased spasticity, and his GCS score decreased to 10; laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (23×10^3/mm^3). A repeat CT of the brain showed no new findings. He was treated empirically for meningitis with antibiotics and returned to the ICU. He remained febrile to 40.0°C, with a central venous pressure of 1 cm H₂O, labile blood pressure, and tachycardia. On day 11, his spasticity worsened, his temperature rose to 40.5°C, and his GCS score fell to 8, necessitating reintubation.

SAE is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients with severe sepsis, characterized by altered mental status, seizures, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's history of a motor vehicle crash, subdural hematoma, and previous use of antipsychotic medication increase the risk of developing SAE. Additionally, the patient's recurrent fever, increased spasticity, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are consistent with SAE.

SAE is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients with severe sepsis, characterized by altered mental status, seizures, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's history of a motor vehicle crash, subdural hematoma, and previous use of antipsychotic medication increase the risk of developing SAE. Additionally, the patient's recurrent fever, increased spasticity, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are consistent with SAE. The negative septic workup and unchanged repeat head CT further support this diagnosis.\n",

            "    A 62‐year‐old man with end‐stage diabetic nephropathy has been on hemodialysis for two years. Two years earlier he underwent transmetatarsal amputation of the right foot and amputation of two toes of the left foot. His medications include insulin and lanthanum carbonate; he is not taking vitamin K antagonists. He has chronic ulcerated wounds on his lower limbs. He first noted painful, whitish macules on the glans penis, surrounded by erythema and mild pruritus. Candidiasis was diagnosed clinically and treated with topical antifungal agents without improvement. A biopsy of the balanic mucosa led to a diagnosis of lichen planus, and topical steroids were prescribed. \n",
            "\n",
            "Three months later, he returned with a diffuse whitish “cardboard” appearance of the balanic mucosa that was subjectively painless and an area of necrosis around the urinary meatus. On examination, the distal phalanges of the right hand also showed early digital necrosis. Laboratory studies showed a serum phosphorus level of 0.71 mmol/L, a calcium level of 2.20 mmol/L, and an intact parathyroid hormone level of 181 pg/mL. Computed tomography angiography of the trunk and right upper limb revealed calcification of the aorta and of the radial and ulnar arteries.

The patient's symptoms of left-sided weakness, urinary incontinence, ataxia, headache, and photophobia are consistent with neurosyphilis. The patient's brain MRI findings of extensive vasogenic edema of the frontoparietal lobes, nodular enhancement of the frontoparietal lobes and along the superior sagittal sinus, and multiple nodular dural enhancements along the right interhemispheric fissure are also consistent with neurosyphilis. The patient's noncontrast head CT findings of large bilateral hypoattenuated areas in the supraventricular white matter, effacement of sulci and the right lateral ventricle, and three osteolytic lesions in the right frontal bone are also consistent with neurosyphilis.

            "    </answer> [/INST] Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is a rare condition called \"deep vein thrombosis\" (DVT). DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, typically in the lower extremity. The patient's presentation of sudden onset of left knee pain and difficulty flexing the knee, along with the absence of a palpable lesion in the popliteal fossa, are consistent with DVT. The ultrasound findings of patent popliteal vessels without thrombosis or flow abnormalities suggest that the patient does not have a venous blockage. The electroneurography findings of normal latencies, amplitudes, and conduction velocities suggest that the patient does not have a peripheral neuropathy. The needle examination of the left gastrocnemius muscle is also normal, ruling out myopathy. The lumbar MRI findings do not suggest a nerve root compression or spinal cord compression, which would be consistent with a neurological cause for the patient's symptoms. Finally, the MRI of the left knee shows a muscle arising near the lateral head of the gastrocnemius, which could be consistent with a rare condition called \"deep vein thrombosis with associated muscle hypertrophy.\" However, this finding is not specific to DVT and further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

GBS is an autoimmune polyneuropathy that causes inflammation and destruction of nerve fibers, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's sudden onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, and subsequent neurological symptoms, such as ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, hoarseness, dry mouth, quadriparesis, and fasciculations, are consistent with GBS. The laboratory findings, such as elevated CPK, SGOT, and SGPT levels, support this diagnosis. The normal results of ECG, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, noncontrast CT head, and nerve conduction studies further strengthen the diagnosis. The negative parenteral neostigmine test also supports the diagnosis.\n",

This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of sex hormones, resulting in a range of physical and neurological abnormalities. The patient's history of neonatal cryptorchidism, micropenis, and lifelong anosmia are consistent with a diagnosis of CAH. The patient' a low level of testosterone and other hormonal imbalances, as well as the presence of a small anterior cranial fossa and facial skeletal asymmetry, suggest a form of CAH known as 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The patient's neurological exam also suggests a possible association with CAH, including ataxia, dysarthria, and facial weakness. The brain MRI findings of an absent olfactory bulb and tracts, along with a small anterior cranial fossa, are consistent with a diagnosis of CAH. The patient's foot radiographs show short fourth metatarsals, which is also consistent with a diagnosis of CAH.

Neurological examination revealed preserved tendon reflexes, flexor plantar responses, a wide-based ataxic gait (20 cm), dystonic inward posture of the left lower limb, inability to tandem walk, dysmetria on finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee testing, left facial weakness, left lateral rectus palsy, and dysarthria.\n",

Facial skeletal asymmetry, elevated orbital roofs, mandibular hypoplasia, high-arched palate, anterior atlas arch displacement, and adenoid hypertrophy were noted. Cervical MRI demonstrated incomplete fusion of C6 and C7. Foot radiographs showed short fourth metatarsals.

            "    </answer> [/INST] Based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of sex hormones, resulting in a range of physical and neurological abnormalities. The patient's history of neonatal cryptorchidism, micropenis, and lifelong anosmia are consistent with a diagnosis of CAH. The patient' a low level of testosterone and other hormonal imbalances, as well as the presence of a small anterior cranial fossa and facial skeletal asymmetry, suggest a form of CAH known as 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The patient's neurological exam also suggests a possible association with CAH, including ataxia, dysarthria, and facial weakness. The brain MRI findings of an absent olfactory bulb and tracts, along with a small anterior cranial fossa, are consistent with a diagnosis of CAH. The patient's foot radiographs show short fourth metatarsals, which is also consistent with a diagnosis of CAH. Overall, the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a diagnosis of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH).\n",

            "    A 17-year-old Vietnamese American male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode, generalized muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. Two months prior, he had been diagnosed with Graves’ disease based on a TSH of 0.007 mIU/mL, free T4 > 7 ng/dL, and positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and was started on atenolol and methimazole 10 mg three times daily. Thyroid ultrasonography showed markedly increased internal vascularity. On the morning of presentation, he was found on the floor 30 minutes after a thud; he recalled his legs “gave out” and he struck his face. In the emergency department, his heart rate was 116 bpm, blood pressure 131/50 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min. Examination revealed diffuse and significant muscle weakness in all extremities, including grip strength; he was alert with no headache or papilledema. Laboratory studies showed potassium 1.6 mmol/L (reference 3.5–5.2) and magnesium 1.6 mmol/L (1.6–2.3); the remainder of the basic metabolic panel was unremarkable. Electrocardiography showed U waves, atrial rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction delay, and a prolonged QTc of 588 ms (normal < 450 ms).

Physical examination demonstrated a firm mass in the left level III region; the thyroid bed was free of palpable abnormalities. Neck ultrasonography showed no residual thyroid tissue and revealed a 2.8 × 1.7 cm solid, inhomogeneous, vascular mass in the left level III region that did not have the sonographic appearance of a normal lymph node. Contrast-enhanced CT of the head and neck confirmed a 2.8 × 1.7 cm enlarged lymph node in the left level III, with no other neck or thyroid-bed lesions. Two ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies yielded cellular specimens with groups of epithelial cells in flat sheets and papillary-like clusters; the cells demonstrated enlarged nuclei with grooves and occasional intranuclear inclusions.

            "    A 55-year-old Japanese man with a 13-year history of diabetes was brought to the hospital after a sudden loss of consciousness and bilateral convulsions (day 0). On examination, he was afebrile (temperature 36.8 °C), hypertensive (blood pressure 142/92 mmHg), and tachycardic (heart rate 108 beats/min). He had left-sided hemiparesis that was unresponsive to painful stimuli. Laboratory evaluation showed a pH of 6.95 and a blood glucose level of 486 mg/dL, consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was treated with fluid resuscitation, insulin infusion, and potassium supplementation; consciousness returned after 12 hours and hemiparesis diminished by day 1.  \n",
            "Given concern for cerebral infarction, MRI of the brain with FLAIR sequences was performed, revealing bilateral lesions in the right temporal lobe, right parietal lobe, and left temporal lobe that did not conform to a vascular distribution. The most prominent lesion shifted from the right temporal lobe on day 0 to the right parietal lobe by day 9. Serial measurement of the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio was repeatedly above 20 (reference <15). Convulsions are rare in DKA but are frequently associated with metabolic encephalopathy, particularly in mitochondrial disorders.\n",

This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the mitochondria, leading to impaired energy production and neurological symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and cognitive impairment. The patient's history of diabetes and the presence of bilateral lesions on MRI suggest a possible association with mitochondrial dysfunction. The elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio also supports this diagnosis.\n",
